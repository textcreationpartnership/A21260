         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <note place="margin">Paul deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by his office.</note>] The word Apoſtle in generall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſignifies one ſent as a Meſſenger: in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this addition <hi>[of Ieſus Christ]</hi> it ſignifies more ſpecially one called immediately by Chriſt to preach the Goſpell, and by him ſent to the whole world, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, and to that end furniſhed with vnderſtanding and knowledge of the Goſpell, and doctrine of ſaluation, immediately by the inſpiration and reuelation from the ſpirit of Chriſt, hauing infallible aſſiſtance and teſtimonie of the holy Ghoſt, that hee cannot erre in executing his Apoſtolical office, and hauing alſo the gift of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, of conferring the holy Ghoſt by laying on of hands and of correction, as <hi>Peter</hi> corrected <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Act.</hi> 5.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:490:17"/> to put a difference between himſelfe and falſe Apoſtles; whence only note we thus much,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that all true teachers are able to ſhew their commiſſion that they are lawfully called and ſent to preach, that they haue both the inward and outward lawfull calling.

Much leſſe ought any to take on him the office of a publike teacher without lawfull calling. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Anabaptiſticall to thinke that any man that will may preach without ſpeciall calling. A word is ſufficient of that point. In that <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, one immediately called and ſent ſent by him to preach the goſpell, it followeth vpon this neceſſarily, that his doctrine deliuered in this, and in his other Epiſtles, is heauenly, and is to be embraced, beleeued, and followed as the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus. For why? his doctrine being giuen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the ſpirit of Chriſt, both for matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he teaching as hee was acted and moued by infallible aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of Chriſt, it muſt needs be the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted oracle and immediate word of Chriſt, and ſo to be receiued. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore giues thankes to God on the behalfe of the Theſſalonians, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.2.13. that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him and other Apoſtles the word of the preaching of God, not as the word of men, but as it was indeed the word of God. <hi>Obiection.</hi>

But for more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all direction to know what doctrine concluded out of the writings of <hi>Paul</hi> is agreeable to the meaning of the holy Ghoſt in the ſame, we muſt remember two things which by diligent reading and carefull obſeruation any one may eaſily find in the writings of the Apoſtle. Firſt that the whole teaching of the Apoſtle doth run vpon Chriſt his whole doctrine,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.11.</note> as a ſtructure or houſe is built on Chriſt the foundation as himſelfe ſpeaketh, no man more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the glory of Chriſt, euincing and proouing iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſaluation in and by him alone, and none more withſtood ſuch as preached the law or intermingled the law with the Goſpell in the matter of iuſtification then he did, we preach Chriſt &amp;c. and Chap. 2.2.

Cor. 1.24.</note> &amp;c. and many like ſentences we find in his Epiſtles he runs almoſt in euery line vpon the name of Chriſt and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his glory. The ſecond thing to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred is that in the doctrine of the Apoſtle concerning the worſhip and ſeruice of God, which we are to performe in way of thankfulneſſe for his mercy,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> the Apoſtle doth vrge vpon vs inward holineſſe and ſpirituall worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.

By theſe two generall things remembred we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcerne who expound the writings of the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:490:19"/> and deriue doctrine from thence conſonant to the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, (namely) they, who with the apoſtle preach Chriſt with all due reſpect of his glory in the worke of redemption and ſaluation, and without any impeachment or derogation from him in regard of his kingly, prieſtly, or Propheticall office, they that teach Chriſt in all things to haue the preheminence as it is verſ. 18. of this Chapter, and propound ſpirituall worſhip and ſeruice of God ſtanding in mortification of the fleſh and newneſſe of life, and that theſe are eſſentiall notes of true doctrine we find them laid before vs by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle the fourth, in the triall of ſpirits in diſcerning the ſpirit of truth from the ſpirit of error, he teacheth that the doctrine is good and of God that is founded on Ieſus Chriſt incarnate, and holds the truth of his incarnation. And ſecondly that propoundeth ſpirituall worſhip of God for ſaith he verſe 5. falſe teachers and Antichriſtian ſpirits are of the world and ſpeake of the world, they are earthly and carnall they teach a plauſible and pleaſing worſhip fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the folly and corruption of mans nature, conſiſting in bodily exerciſes rites and ceremonies, things of great eſtimation and admiration in the world; on the contrary the teachers and ſpirits that are of God, euen in outward actions of religion require inward heauenly and ſpirituall worſhip of God agreeable to the will and nature of God ſtanding in true faith of the heart, true contrition of the ſoule and other fruits of Gods ſpirit.

We are further to marke that <hi>Paul</hi> riſeth vp and aſcendeth from his calling to the will of God, that he was now called to be an Apoſtle and being called he knew the Lord had before in his will and purpoſe appointed him to that office, for he knew not this but by the euent: whence ariſeth this doctrine that <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now to the ſalutation in the words following. <hi>Grace, &amp;c.</hi> Wherin the Apoſtle wiſheth &amp; praieth for two things to be giuen, <hi>Grace and peace,</hi> both from God the fountain of grace and peace, and from him not as an abſolute God but as our father, and from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt the mediator, by whom all good things come vnto vs; here then in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation two generall things are to be ſtood vpon.<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Firſt the things wiſhed and praied for (grace and peace) ſecondly, from whom they deſcend and come vnto vs. For the firſt, touching the fence and meaning of the words, we find in ſcripture a twofold acception of the word. <hi>(Grace)</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth either the free and gratious fauour of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth accept and is well pleaſed with his choſen in and for Chriſt, giuing them remiſſion of ſinnes iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adoption, &amp;c. or grace giuen, the gift of grace wrought in vs by his ſpirit, in both theſe acceptions we find the word vſed in one and the ſame ſentence. Now here we are to vnderſtand it in the firſt ſignification only,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.15.</note> as ſignifying the gratious fauour of God; whereby he doth imbrace his choſen,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> and the word <hi>peace</hi> doth comprehend both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, tranquility of mind and conſcience ſpoken of, and outward peace with the creature, as Angels and men,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:490:26"/> yea with the beaſts and ſtones as it is,<note place="margin">Iob. 5.23.</note> and outward welfare, proſperity and good ſucceſſe, for ſo we read, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> asked his brethren of their peace,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.27.</note> or as the word is tranſlated of their proſperity. When therfore the Apoſtle wiſheth grace and peace to the Coloſſians, it is as much as if he had ſaid, I wiſh you the free and gratious fauour of God in Chriſt Ieſus, and likewiſe quietneſſe of conſcience in reſpect of Gods fauour, and outward peace with all the creatures, yea good ſucceſſe and proſperity in all things. Hence firſt we are to marke that the Apoſtle in his wiſh and praier for good to the Coloſſians, giues the firſt place to the grace and fauour of God, wiſhing them firſt grace, then peace. <label type="milestone">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:490:26"/> giues comfort and conſolation, yea it worketh ſuch reſt and reioycing of heart as all the goods in the world cannot yeeld. A man vpon his death bed galled with a guilty conſcience would giue all the world (if it were his) for the leaſt dram of that comfort Gods children find in the apprehenſion of Gods fauour. Theſe things may ſerue not only to make knowne and to proue the truth of this, that Gods grace and fauour is moſt excellent, but alſo to affect and ſtir vp our Chriſtian ſoules to breath and ſeeke after it aboue all things in the world, and let the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the excellency of Gods fauour in Chriſt ſtir vs vp to ſpend both time and ſtrength, not after the manner of the world, in hunting after riches and pleaſures, but that we may find ſome aſſurance of Gods fauour towards vs, and to this end carefully vſe we the meanes appointed both to beget in vs faith in the blood of Chriſt, whereby we may be aſſured of it, as hearing, reading, meditating in the word of God with praier, and alſo to ratifie &amp; confirm; the ſame, as a frequent and a reuerent vſe of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place in that the Apoſtle ioines theſe two <label type="milestone">

                     </label> this point being thus cleered and prooued,<note place="margin">Confutation of inuocation of Angels &amp; Saints.</note> it meeteth with the opinion of the Papiſts, who hold and labour to maintaine inuocation of Angels and Saints departed, that opinion cannot ſtand with this truth of God: but they endeauor to vphold their opinion by this reaſon; ſay they it is lawfull to call vpon men liuing heere vpon the earth, while wee liue together we may requeſt one anothers prayers as <hi>Paul</hi> did, therfore it is lawfull to call on Saints departed, for ſay they, if it be not lawfull,<note place="margin">Rom. 15 30.</note> then is it for one of theſe cauſes, either becauſe they will not heare vs, but (ſay they) that is not ſo, becauſe now they haue greater loue vnto vs; then when they were on the earth: or becauſe they know not what we pray for, but that alſo is not ſo, becauſe look how the Angels know the conuerſion of a ſinner and reioyce, ſo the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted know it, or laſtly, becauſe iniury is done to God or to Chriſt, but this is otherwiſe, for then wee might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt men liuing to pray for vs.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:490:32"/>
                  <p>This argument hath many branches. Firſt I anſwer to it in generall, that the conſequent is naught, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the liuing to pray for vs, therefore we may pray to Saints departed, becauſe for the firſt we haue both precept and promiſe, for the other neither. Againe, touching their proofes firſt it is true, Saints departed haue greater loue, for loue continueth for euer.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.8.</note> Yet the loue of Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is nothing elſe but a conſtant vnchangeable and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall deſire, whereby they wiſh eternall happineſſe and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to the whole Church of God, and to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that the kingdome of Chriſt might be perfected in all his members, thus we may grant that Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doe pray for vs that is, they wiſh well to the whole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church, and to all the members equally and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, but to ſay they pray for one and not for another, cannot be granted, becauſe it is contrary to that loue they beare equally to all, and further they are exempt from that feeling of our particular miſeries, which they had on the earth, becauſe that would detract from their perfect ioy and glory, therefore we may not conclude from their loue, that they pray for any one in particular. Secondly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſay, as the Angells know the conuerſion of a ſinner ſo the ſaints departed know it. We anſwer, there is not the ſame reaſon why the ſaints departed ſhould know it as the Angells doe; becauſe the Angells are appointed miniſtring ſpirits and know many particulars which happen vnto vs,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> and many of our priuate neceſſities, but the Saints do not, being alwaies abſent, and yet worſhip, and conſequently inuocation of Angels is forbidden in the ſecond Chapter of this Epiſtle and eighteenth verſe, therefore much more of Saints they neither knowing nor hearing our prayers <hi>Ob.</hi> God reueales to them what is praied for; we anſwer againe, this appeares not by any place of ſcripture. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to what end ſhould we pray vnto them if they know not what we aske but by reuelation (and to the laſt thing they alledge we anſwer. That it doth derogate from Gods glory
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:490:33"/> and from the perfect mediation of Chriſt to call on Saints departed, whereas they except. Then to requeſt the liuing to pray for vs, we anſwer as before, the caſe is not alike. Firſt becauſe we haue both precept and promiſe for the one and not for the other. Secondly, we make not the liuing mediators, as they doe Saints departed, but only requeſt their mutuall praiers to commend our ſuites to Chriſt our head; they hauing a fellow feeling of our wants, as we haue of theirs, and ſo as members together, we ſend vp our mutuall praiers vnto God, and exerciſe our charity one towards another, and ſo notwithſtanding this cauilling of the Papiſts it ſtill remaines a firme truth that inuocation and prayer belongs only to God.</p>
                  <p>Now to the Apoſtles deſcription of God to whom he gaue thanks and praied; God is here deſcribed by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt, that he is the father of Chriſt our Lord and Sauiour,<note place="margin">God is the father of Chriſt as he is God, and as he is man.</note> the word <hi>(father)</hi> here ſtanding in relation to Chriſt is taken perſonally as before we noted, and that we may rightly conceiue how God is the father of Chriſt, Chriſt being both God and man, we muſt know that God is the father of Chriſt in reſpect of his deity, by nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is of the ſame eternall eſſence with the father, begotten from all eternity, and ſo the only begotten ſonne of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> and in reſpect of his humanity, not becauſe he had ſubſtance of body and ſoule from the ſubſtance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but becauſe as man he was conceiued by the worke of the holy Ghoſt, and by perſonall vnion his humanity is aſſumed and doth ſubſiſt in his deity,<note place="margin">Luk 1.35.</note> the word was made fleſh, and thus God is the father of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.14.</note>We are further to marke that God is the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">How we are to conceiue of Chriſt in reſpect of Gods choſen.</note> whereby the Apoſtle giues vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how we are to conceiue of Chriſt in reſpect of Gods choſen, as that he is their ſauiour and their Lord, not only as he is Lord ouer all creatures, but in more ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that in a double reſpect, firſt in reſpect of freee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from his father,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.9.</note> ſecondly in reſpect of his worke

And this is the Apoſtles ordinary forme of praier and thanksgiuing in the beginning almoſt of euery Epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle: Our leſſon hence is this, that our praiers to God muſt in like manner be offered vp in the name and mediation <label type="milestone">

How the Papiſts do cauil on this place it is known, ſay they Chriſt is the only mediator of redemption, but the ſaints are mediators of interceſſion, this diſtinction is moſt fooliſh, it makes the body not anſwer to the ſhadow, nor the trueth correſpondent to the figures, for the high prieſt in time of the law was in figure a mediator both of expiation by ſacrifices, &amp; of interceſſion by praiers,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> &amp; did ſhadow and ſhew, that in time of the new teſtament both theſe things ſhould be conioyned and meete together in Chriſt: again, it doth rob Chriſt of a great part of his honor belonging to his Prieſthood, for Chriſt hath not onely by his owne ſufficient ſacrifice, conſecrated, but ſits alſo at the right hand of his Father, to make requeſt for them.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:490:39"/> other qualities and workes, bee ſo farre foorth good, as as they come from faith, and faith it ſelfe, as a quality or worke doth not iuſtifie vs in the ſight of God, then much leſſe can any other grace or worke do it; it is the pride of our corrupt nature to look for iuſtification, &amp; ſaluation by ſome thing in our ſelues, if wee liue in ciuill faſhion in the world, and we hurt none &amp;c. then wee are lift vp in a conceipt of this, and we thinke we cannot chuſe but be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, thus the Diuell taking aduantage of our pride, doth teach men to encroach vpon the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, for whereas he hath taught that good life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt conuerſation ſerues onely as an euidence and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proofe of true faith in the bloud of Chriſt, the diuell teacheth to aduance theſe things to a higher place of dignity,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.4.</note> euen to ſhoulder out Gods grace and merits of Chriſt in our iuſtification, but wee muſt know as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath taught vs, if we looke to be iuſtified by any thing in our ſelues we are aboliſhed &amp;c. faith in Chriſt Ieſus and confidence in good workes cannot ſtand together, faith and good workes euer goe together, and true faith is euer fruitfull in good workes, but faith and confidence or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the merit of good workes cannot ſtand together. If we looke to be iuſtified and ſaued by Chriſt, wee muſt cleaue onely vnto him, and vtterly renounce confidence of all things in our ſelues, wee muſt iudge our ſelues, and condemn our ſelues in regard of any thing in vs, and plead nothing but mercy and forgiueneſſe, wee muſt goe out of our ſelues and fixe our faith vpon Ieſus Chriſt, and be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded in our hearts, that his death is our ranſome, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now come wee to the obiect of loue, that is (all Saints) true ſanctified loue comming from faith is to be extended
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:490:39"/> in the fruits of it to all men, as they are men bearing the image of God, but eſpecially, to ſuch as are ſanctified and renued according to Gods image in ſome meaſure of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and it muſt be teached generally to all Saints, as the Coloſſians did, ſo we are not onely to loue one or two or a certaine ſet number, but all Saints without exception, we are to beare hearty affection to all generally, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it in duties of loue, to as many as we are able (ſaith <hi>Dauid) Lord my weldoing &amp;c.</hi> but to the Saints,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.5.</note> and hee ſpeakes indefinitely, to the Saints that are heere on earth and to the excellent; reaſons of this are theſe, firſt, all the Saints are members of one body, and it is a law layd on the members of the naturall body by the prouidence of God, that what ability is giuen to any member, it ſhould be vſed for the good of the whole body, and of euery part of the body? that the ſight of the eye ſhould bee vſed as well for the direction of the foot, as for the guiding of the hand. So in the myſticall body of Chriſt, what good pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall grace or affection is wrought in any, it ſhould bee extended to the good of the whole body, and of euery particular member of the body. Secondly, there is the ſame reaſon and ground of loue in euery Saint of God; namely, the image of God renued, their holines and feare of God, though not the ſame meaſure, they all reſemble God their Father in ſome degree of holineſſe, and ſhew that they are begotten of the immortall ſeed of his word, therfore loue being bounded &amp; ſet on goodnes, &amp; that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing found in ſome meaſure in euery Saint of God, we are to extend our loue to all &amp; euery Saint &amp; ſeruant of God, but for the better cleering of this point a queſtion muſt be anſwered, namely, <label type="milestone">

Secondly, in equall compariſon, when men are equall in degree, we are then in the firſt place, principally to loue and ſhew duties of loue to Parents, children and ſuch as are conioyned and tied vnto vs by nature, or any outward bond of marriage or friendſhip, becauſe wee are bound to loue them by a double bond of nature and of grace, grace doth not aboliſh naturall affection, but onely order it and diſpoſe it aright, and ſo the queſtion is anſwered and the doctrine cleered.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe, the Apoſtle doth lay before vs two things. Firſt, wherefore it was that the Coloſſians continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in their faith in Chriſt Ieſus and loue towards all Saints. What was the motiue that ſtirred them vp to goe on in faith and loue, namely, the hope layd vp for them in Heauen. Secondly, the meanes how they came to the knowledge of that hope, and that was by their hearing of the Goſpell, which is deſcribed to be the word of truth and their hearing of this hope, by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell is further amplified by the time that they heard of it, before the writing of this Epiſtle. Whereof (ſayth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) ye haue heard before, come wee to the firſt of theſe two generall things in theſe words, <hi>for the hopes ſake,</hi> by hope in this place wee are to vnderſtand, not the gift or grace of hope wrought in true beleeuers following true faith, but the thing hoped for, the thing certainely expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of all that truely beleeue eternall happineſſe, glory and life euerlaſting, and that is cleere out of the text it ſelfe, becauſe the gift or grace of hope is in the heart, but this is heere ſayd to bee layd vp in heauen: (laid vp) that phraſe is borrowed from Parents, who lay vp good things to bee giuen in time to come to their children, the meaning is that the Lord hath as it were laid vp, prouided and prepared life, happines and glory in time to be giuen to his children, ſo we find it in the laſt doome that Chriſt ſhall pronounce vpon the bleſſed of his father,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:490:41"/>

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25.34.</note> In heauen, that is in the place and ſeat of the bleſſed Angells and Saints, whether Chriſt is aſcended, and from whence he ſhall come to iudgement, this then is the true ſence of theſe words, for the eternall happineſſe life and glories ſake, prepared of the Lord from all eterniry in time to be giuen you in the higheſt heauens. Now firſt in that glory and life to come is called by the name of hope, one of theſe is put for another, one to ſignifie another, hope to ſignifie heauen.</p>

Rather rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus with thy ſelfe, am I careleſſe of the meanes the Lord hath appointed to bring me to the knowledge of ſaluation, then I may iuſtly feare that I belong not to Gods election. For whom the Lord hath appointed to ſuch an end, he hath appointed to the meanes, and doth ſweetly incline and bend the purpoſe of the will that way; whom

For why they haue no ſtrength againſt the corruption of their owne hearts; nor any power of grace to withſtand the temptation of ſatan, but with full ſwing run after the vanities of the world, and the pleaſures of ſinne, and ſo lie open to Gods wrath, which hangs ouer the heads of all vnbeleeuers, being deſtitute of Chriſt the robe of righteouſneſſe, wanting faith, mortification, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and the whole armour of God, a ſtate wretched and damnable; let the conſideration of it moue vs to make a ſpeciall accompt of hearing the word, wherby our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be informed, our wills reformed, our affections ordered, and euery thought brought into captiuity to the obedience of Chriſt.

As he is kind to offer grace, ſo he is iuſt to reuenge the wilfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his offer, and he will proportion out the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the refuſall of his mercie, he will make it ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and agreeable to the ſinne, that as we reiect and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard his mercie offered, ſo in time of trouble hee will not regard our miſery, but he will laugh,<note place="margin">Pro. 1.26.</note> &amp;c. a ſentence full of terrour.

So much of the firſt argument of commendation of the Goſpell, in theſe words, <hi>(which is come, &amp;c.)</hi> Now to the ſecond argument <hi>(is fruitful in all the world)</hi> for theſe words muſt be reſumed and repeated, to make a perfect ſentence: the Goſpel is here ſaid to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both generally in all the world, and in ſpeciall among the Coloſſians in two reſpects. 1. in reſpect of the number of ſuch as were conuerted daily &amp;c. in reſpect of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, who by the preaching of it were daily increaſed, as we read there were added to the Church by the ſermon of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> about three thouſand ſoules, and verſe 47.<note place="margin">Act. 2.41.</note> it is ſaid the Lord added to the Church from day to day ſuch as ſhould be ſaued. Secondly, in reſpect of the proceeding of thoſe beleeuers, and of them that were conuerted in faith, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, and other graces. The original text in ſome examples hath two words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which plainly ſhew that this word <hi>(fruitfull)</hi> ſeruing to expreſſe them both, hath this extenſion, to ſignifie both increaſe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and increaſe of faith and holy fruits, that the Goſpell was fruitfull in conuerting many, and powerfull in them that were conuerted, both generally in all parts of the

Now what profit comes by it to know that the goſpell is the power of God to the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many others, if it were of the whole world, and not of thy ſelfe? What comfort is it to know that many are brought by the goſpell to the way of life, and thy ſelfe left in the way that leadeth downe to hell? nay rather what diſcomfort comes by ſuch knowledge? To haue the eie of the mind blinded, and not be able to ſee &amp; conceiue in the vnderſtanding the power of the goſpell, is an heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but to ſee the power of it in the abſtract in it ſelfe in generall, and not in our ſelues, that is the very deuils caſe, and it ought to be conſidered and thought vpon. Come we to the words following, wherein the ſpeciall working of the Goſpell among the Coloſſians is amplified, that it was fruitfull from the day that they heard, and truly or in truth knew the grace of God: the Goſpell is heere called the grace of God, becauſe it teacheth that remiſſion of ſins and life euerlaſting are obtained onely by the meere grace and mercie of God in Chriſt. The point of inſtruction hence offered is this: In that it is ſaid that the Goſpell was fruitfull among the Coloſſians, vpon their hearing and true knowledge, not of the Goſpell, but of the grace of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:490:52"/> God propounded vnto them in the Goſpell; we are taught that then onely is the Goſpell powerfull to worke vpon vs,<note place="margin">The Goſpell is powerfull to make vs bring foorth good fruit, when wee haue a feeling knowledge of the comfort of it.

This order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding, from a feeling of ſweetneſſe to fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we finde laid before vs by the Prophet <hi>Dauid:</hi> hee there ſaith that the iudgements of the Lord were ſweeter than the hony and the hony combe; and then he addes, that by them he was made circumſpect.

When ſhe felt much comfort in Gods grace for the pardon of many ſinnes, then ſhee brought foorth many good fruits. And there is great reaſon for this, that the true knowledge of the grace of God in the goſpell, ſhould make vs fruitfull in euery good word and worke. For when wee feelingly know the grace of God reuealed in the goſpell, then wee know wee are within the compaſſe of Gods ſpeciall loue, wee are aſſured of his comfortable preſence and protection, of our portion in his promiſe of life and ſaluation, of right and title to all the comforts and bleſſings belonging to the ſaints of God.

For ſurely we ſhall but heare as a pleaſant ſong, as the Lord ſaith, nay we ſhall but cauill at it, till wee haue a feeling knowledge of the comfort of it. The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did but prattle with Chriſt, till he told her of her ſinne, and brought her to a true ſight of her ſinne, then ſhe humbled her ſelfe, and confeſſed her ſinne.

Come and ſee a man which hath told me all things that euer I did: is not he that Chriſt? So wee ſhall but prattle of the Goſpell, and make it but table talke, till wee be humbled in our ſelues, and haue a true knowledge and an inward feeling of the comfort of it.

The Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> ſuch as are ordained to rule and gouerne others, they are Gods miniſters, they are appointed of the Lord, for the good of thoſe that be vnder them, they haue a talent in truſt giuen vnto them.

We read in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, of the vigilancie, care &amp; diligence of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that neither the difficultie and infinite labours of his calling,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:490:57"/> the contumacy, vntowardneſſe, and ingratitude of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the emulation and grudging of equalls, did any whit hinder him from going on with courage and conſtancy in his duty: the Lord therefore himſelfe with his owne mouth, giues him this commendarion.<note place="margin">Numb. 12.7.</note> That he was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all his houſe, and that muſt needs be moſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable which the Lord commends in any man.

If we do but conſider, how the diuell labours, to make men put in truſt by the Lord with gifts and places of rule and gouernment, vnfaithfull, and not to anſwer the truſt repoſed in them, that ſo their condemnation may be the deeper, and that he may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the profit of others, who might be bettered by them: the truth of this will eaſily appeare that in any place of rule, it is moſt commendable to be faithfull, he by ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion teacheth men, as we ſee by experience to ſay (when they are vrged to doe their duty) what can I doe?

The Apoſtle thought it not ſufficient to write vnto the Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and to labour with them by inſtruction and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to confirme them in the true faith, but he further ſaith he ceaſed not to bee inſtant with the Lord in prayer for them, that they might be fulfilled with knowledge of his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:490:60"/> will, whence it followes that prayer, not onely of others, but of vs for our ſelues, is a notable means for the encreaſe of our ſpirituall knowledge,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.5.</note> this is taught moſt plainely if any man lacke wiſedome, if any hauing a ſmall meaſure of wiſdome find an emptines, a defect and want of wiſdome and knowledge (as no man but ſhall if he be able to ſift his owne braine) and would haue a ſupplie, let him aske of God which giueth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man, and it ſhall be giuen him. The reaſons of this are theſe: firſt, it is a confeſſed truth, that the knowledge of Gods will reuealed in his word, comes by illumination of the ſpirit of Chriſt in whoſe power it is to open and ſhut the booke of God at his pleaſure. Wee are not able of our ſelues, to vnderſtand the plaineſt things deliuered in the word.<note place="margin">Luk. 11.13.</note> Now the ſpirit of grace and illumination is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the prayer of faith: ſo ſaith our Sauiour, if ye which are euill, can giue good gifts vnto your Children, how much more ſhall your heauenly Father giue the holy Ghoſt to them that deſire him? Whence it followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily that prayer is a ſpeciall meanes for the encreaſe of knowledge. Againe true prayer, the praier of faith is not onely a meanes to fit, to prepare and to ſanctifie out hearts to receiue grace; but euen the very action of praier, though it doe not merit, yet doth it encreaſe in ſome particulars, a further meaſure of grace and ſanctification: for example, true prayer for the pardon of ſinne worketh greater care to auoyd ſinne, it is not poſſible that a man ſhould make a plaine and hearty confeſſion of any ſinne to God in prayer and deſire him to pardon it and promiſe amendment, but that by the very confeſſion he ſhould be bettered and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from that ſinne: Hence it is that our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>watch and pray, that ye enter not into tentation:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> that hee may be ſtrengthened and better able to withſtand temptation. So then, prayer being a meanes to fit, and prepare our hearts to receiue grace, and the very action of prayer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing a further meaſure of grace, in ſome particulars, it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:490:61"/> muſt needs be a notable meanes for the encreaſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall knowledge.</p>

Many neuer thinke of this duty, many of vs either lie ſecurely bathing our ſelues in our beds till the inſtant time of comming to the publike aſſembly, or elſe if we riſe it is either to follow after worldly affaires, or to tricke and trim vp our bodies, and few or none of vs haue any care to fit and prepare our ſelues to ſanctifie our ſoules before we come to the hearing of the word, but we come laden with our ſinnes and with our minds ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with diuerſe luſts, and ſo it comes to paſſe that the ſpeech of the Apoſtle is verified vpon vs,<note place="margin">2.

Remember therfore before we come to the hearing or the word, to lift vp our ſoules in praier to God, and euen to ſtretch out the faculties and powers of our ſoules, as men in bodily exerciſe ſtretch out the ioints of their bodies, we ſhall thereby no doubt finde and feele a great alteration in our ſoules, that they are more quicke and ready to receiue heauenly nouriſhment.

                  <p>In that he ſaith, he did not only pray for the Coloſſians, <label type="milestone">

It is to be marked, that our Sauiour ſaith not, whatſoeuer yee pray for, but whatſoeuer ye deſire when ye pray, beleeue that yee ſhall haue it, and it ſhall be done vnto you. And that praier muſt be with an inward deſire, it appeares euen by the Lords manner of dealing with his children,<note place="margin">Mark 11.24.</note> who vſeth meanes to whet and ſharpen their deſires, ſometimes by deferring to grant their requeſts.

For example, a man giuen to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomarie ſwearing, being told of it, and reproued for it, he will ſometimes lift vp his voice in praier, and ſay, I pray God giue me grace to leaue it, which is a good ſpeech, and a ſpeech bearing ſhew of inward deſire to leaue that ſinne, but indeed many times there is no ſuch matter, for he ſtill forgets himſelfe, and oathes are ſtill common with him.

Such as pray for grace and ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne with a true ſanctified deſire, they ioine to their deſire, the holy vſe of other meanes, and their deſire is not flitting &amp; vaniſhing, but conſtant, and they giue the Lord no reſt till he grant their deſire, yea they vſe vehement and vrging arguments to the Lord, to moue him to grant it; they vrge the former fauour and mercie of God in helping them againſt other ſinnes: they pray that the Lord will not ſuffer their enemie Satan to ouercome them: they preſſe the Lord with his promiſe, Aske and you ſhal haue, ſeeke and you ſhall finde. Thus it is with them that haue a true ſanctified deſire of grace and ſtrength againſt ſinne. And to ſtirre vp our dulneſſe in this caſe, conſider we, firſt that praier without a true deſire of the heart is meere moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie, &amp; cannot eſcape vnpuniſhed, the Lord denounceth a woe againſt it. Againe,<note place="margin">Hoſea 7.14.</note> praier ſent out from a true deſire of the heart, and offered vp in Chriſt, is pleaſing to God, yea though it be but a deſire true and heartie, when the voice faileth, yet then it pierceth the clouds. Looke on the example of <hi>Hannah:</hi> Shee ſpake in her heart,<note place="margin">1.

                     <note place="margin">Iſay 38, 14.</note> Like a Crane did he chatter, yet the Lord heard his praier.

The words carry this ſenſe, that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge, that is to ſay, that ye might increaſe in knowledge, and come to that meaſure the Lord hath appointed neceſſary for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.7.</note> (for ſome of the members of Chriſt haue one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſome another, according to that) yet euery one ſo much as is neceſſarie to ſaluation, which the Apoſtle here praied for (of his will) that is the will of God reuealed tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching things to be beleeued &amp; practiſed.<note place="margin">Credenda &amp; ſacienda.</note> Now in that the Apoſtle lifts vp his praier to God, for the Coloſſians, and deſired of him, that they hauing ſome meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> might receiue increaſe of it, we may conclude, that not only the beginning,<note place="margin">Both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the free gift of God.</note> but a further meaſure of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and vnderſtanding of Gods will, is the free gift of God, it is the Lords bountie and largeſſe, it comes vnto vs as alms to beggars, freely, it is gotten by earneſt intreating and ſuing for, at the hands of God, yet not for the merit of any intreatie, as the beggar gets not his almes for the worthineſſe of his crauing, but of the meere bounty of the giuer. So wee get increaſe of knowledge from the meere mercy of God, and in greater or leſſe meaſure according to the good pleaſure of the Lord. The Apoſtle ſaith, that the ſpirit diſtributeth his gifts as he will,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.11.</note> the diſtribution of the gifts of Gods ſpirit is voluntary, therefore free, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall diſtribution of the gift of knowledge, in that ſome haue a greater meaſure of knowledge then others, is a clear proofe that the increaſe comes from the meere bounty of the Lord, not from reſpect had of any thing in vs; for if the Lord ſhould giue a different meaſure of knowledge, not freely, but vpon deſert, then in all likelihood they who haue a greater meaſure of faith, ſhould haue a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge, but wee may many times obſerue the contrary, that they haue more knowledge, who haue a leſſe

In the ſecond place, in that the Apoſtle in the fourth verſe gaue teſtimony of the faith of the Coloſſians, and now prayed for the encreaſe of their knowledge of the will of God.</p>
                  <p>We learne that ſuch as truly beleeue in Chriſt, and are <label type="milestone">

Thus our Sauiour dealt with his Apoſtles, when they had confeſſed, that he was the Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God, yet they knew not, the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his death and reſurrection, it is therefore ſayd ver. 21. from that time foorth, Ieſus beganne to ſhew vnto his diſciples, that he muſt goe vnto Ieruſalem, and ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of the Elders, and of the high Prieſts, &amp; Scribes and bee ſlaine, and riſe againe the third day. Wee read though <hi>Apollos</hi> was an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures which did argue an excellent meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">Acts. 18.</note> yet he had his want of knowledge: euen two of his Auditours, <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> as we finde verſe 26. took him home with them, and expounded the way of God more perfectly vnto him, yea Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that hee might encreaſe in comfort and ſtrength of faith, by the faith of the Romans.

In the laſt words of this verſe the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:490:65"/> Apoſtle ſets downe two things wherein the knowledge of Gods will doth conſiſt, namely wiſedome, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and both ſpirituall. The word wiſdome hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acceptions in the Scripture, ſometimes it is put to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie an euill quality,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14.2.</note> the wiſedome of the world properly called craft and ſubtilty, ſometimes it is taken in a good ſence and then alſo diuerſly, as ſometimes to ſignifie the doctrine of wiſedome, ſometimes the habit or quality of wiſedome in the word,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.6.</note> and ſo it is taken in this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtandeth heere in relation to the will of God, and by it is meant, an ability or power of the minde aboue nature, whereby the minde being cleared and disburdened of naturall dulneſſe, vnbeliefe, ignorance and vanity, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoundly and truely to apprehend, to acknowledge and embrace the known truth of the word of God as the Lord ſaith on the contrary,<note place="margin">Ier. 8.9.</note> they haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what wiſedome is in them? though they had the law amongſt them ver. 8. yet becauſe they did not truely apprehend and beleeue it, they are ſayd to reiect it, and conſequently had no wiſedome in them, whence it is cleare, that when wee are wiſe in the knowledge of the will of God, when we truely apprehend, acknowledge and embrace the knowen truth of his word. The word (all) doth not ſignifie all kinde of wiſedome, but a full meaſure of ſpirituall wiſedome neceſſary to ſaluation.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.2.</note> So we find the word vſed, all faith, that is not all kindes of faith, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith is not there meant, but a full meaſure of faith of working miracles. For the word (vnderſtanding) not to ſay any thing of the diſtinction of it into the Theoricall and practicall, by that word is meant, an ability and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whereby the minde is able to apply the knowen truth of the word, to the good ordering both of particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affections and outward things and actions, as time,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 3 9.</note> place and perſon ſhall require. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed, that God would giue him an vnderſtanding heart, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby the affections of his heart might be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:490:66"/> and hee might be able to iudge and diſcerne truely betweene good and bad in particular cauſes and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, and giue ſentence accordingly.

For firſt, he teacheth that we are iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, and then ſanctified, and that our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a fruit of our iuſtification, and therefore, good workes which are part of ſanctification, they follow faith, and are fruits of faith in them that are iuſtified.

It is a manifeſt contradiction, that any worke ſhould haue need of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from God (as all ours haue) and yet fully ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, and deſerue at his hands. Yea more than that, if Chriſt his obedience had beene imperfect, and any way defectiue, though he were God and man, yet it had not beene meritorious of life and ſaluation; for that were to make contradictories true together, which all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, yea Schoole-diuines (from whom the Papiſts fetch the bodie of their diuinitie) hold impoſſible to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe it is an argument of impotencie, not of power.</p>

We need ſeeke no further for the proofe of this, than the word heere vſed (tranſlated) for tranſlation is a ſetting of vs out of one ſtate into another.</p>

As many as will be ſure they are effectually called home, ſo as they cannot goe backe againe to their old courſe, muſt not onely finde themſelues deliuered from their ſinne, but muſt alſo finde the contrary grace wrought in them, yea in ſome caſes the contrary ſpeciall grace: as for example, ſuch as will be ſure they are called out of their naturall blindneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, of themſelues, of the way to life and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt not only finde their mindes enlightned by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall illumination, a bare conceiuing and vnderſtanding of the ſenſe and meaning of the word; that is a common grace, and that may be common to them with the Deuill, and the wicked, but they muſt find in them a ſpecial expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall knowledge, a particular acknowledgement and perſwaſion of the truth of the whole word of God, a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing holy knowledge, which is neuer diſioined from good affection, and then they may be ſure they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called out of their ignorance. Thus it is in other particulars. Let no man then imagine that he is effectually called home, when for a time he hath eſcaped the practiſe of ſome ſin, vnleſſe he can withall ſhew the practiſe of the contrary vertue. And to this purpoſe conſider we but this one thing, that it is not poſſible for a man long to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in that barren and (as I may call it) graceles eſtate in which he doth pleaſe himſelfe, if the ſinne be auoided, and the contrary vertue not practiſed, it cannot be but that he will returne with the dogge to his vomit: for marke what our Sauiour hath left vpon perpetuall record:<note place="margin">Mat. 12.44.</note> When the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirit is gone out of a man, if he returne (as he will

And a little further to preſſe this, can we perſwade our ſelues we are in the ſtate of grace, and vndergrace, and yet abuſe grace, make it an occaſion to all licentious libertie to ſin, make it as a bawd to our lying, ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. If wee doe but waigh this in the ballance of naturall reaſon, it will bee found too light to this purpoſe; for as we vſe to ſay, when a man doth ſell a thing of great worth for a ſmall price, and after that giues himſelfe to rioting and miſpending of that mony, he is a theefe, and no right owner of that hee ſold, the like may be iuſtly ſaid of ſuch as abuſe grace, that they are but vſurpers, &amp; no right owners of it, &amp; that they haue no true lawfull title vnto it. Let this be thought on, and withall remember what wee daily call for, or ought to call for, at the hands of God, namely this, that this kingdome

                  <p>The Apoſtle here beginnes his proofe, of the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the worke of redemption wrought by Chriſt, that he is a perfect and ſufficient Redeemer of Gods choſen, his proofe is laid downe in three verſes, the 15.16. and 17. he prooues it from the dignitie of his perſon, ſhewing that he is true and eternall God, and therefore a perfect Redeemer. And that Chriſt is true and eternall God, is firſt propounded by the Apoſtle, verſ. 15. and then confirmed verſe 16. and 17. In the 15 verſe containing the generall propoſition, are two things affirmed of Chriſt, firſt, that he is the image of the inuiſible God; and ſecondly, the firſt borne of euery creature. Come wee to more ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of theſe things, and for the firſt, I will ſtand a while to open the ſenſe and meaning of the words, and not to trouble you with any curious and vnneceſſary ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, but to hold to the ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle which was to propound ſound Doctrine of faith, and to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:490:106"/> teach how with profit we are to conceiue of the perſon of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Chriſt the image of God his father two waies.</note> Know that Chriſt is the image of God his Father two waies. Firſt, as he is the eternall Sonne, of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father: and ſo his moſt abſolute and perfect eſſentiall image, for hauing the very ſame eternall eſſence and ſubſtance with the Father, he doth moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly repreſent him:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Heb. 1.3.</note> hence he is ſaid to be the brightnes of his glorie, and the engrauen forme of his perſon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as he is God manifeſted in the fleſh, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.16.</note> becauſe God being inuiſible doth manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Chriſt, in whom he hath made himſelfe knowne to vs, to be moſt wiſe, iuſt, and mercifull; moſt wiſe, becauſe in Chriſt he expreſſed towards vs, both perfect iuſtice and perfect mercy; and in Chriſt moſt iuſt, becauſe in him he perfectly puniſhed all our ſinnes laid on him, as on our ſurety, and moſt mercifull alſo in Chriſt, becauſe for his merit and ſatisfaction, he perfectly forgaue his choſen all their ſinnes, and made them heires of his kingdome of glorie, thus is Chriſt the image of God. The next word to be expounded is <hi>(inuiſible)</hi> for the clearing of that, conſider we thus much. That ſeeing is of two ſorts, either with the outward eie of the bodie, or with the eie of the minde. Concerning the outward ſight, whereby curious and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people would be glad to ſee God, hardly thinking there is a God, becauſe they ſee him not with their bodily eies, the truth is, God cannot bee ſeene, becauſe hee is a Spirit moſt ſimple and pure, and not ſubiect to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe, therefore he ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Thou canſt not ſee my face,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 33.20.</note> 
                     <hi>for there ſhall no man ſee me and liue.</hi> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,<note place="margin">1. Tim 6.16.</note> 
                     <hi>God dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man ſaw, neither can ſee;</hi> touching ſight by the eie of the minde, wee muſt diſtinguiſh our eſtate heere in this life, from that it ſhall bee in the life to come, and know that by the minde whileſt we are heere, wee are not able to ſee God as he is in himſelfe, becauſe all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge heere, is by ſome outward formes or faſhions, which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:490:106"/> we conceiue in our minde and vnderſtanding, and though we finde it ſaid, that the Lord ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> face to face;<note place="margin">Exod. 33.11.</note> we are to know that thoſe words note onely a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and gracious manner of ſpeaking, not that he ſaw God in ſubſtance and eſſence as hee is, and in the life to come, as many as goe to heauen ſhall ſee God in a moſt excellent manner, and with ſuch comfort as no heart can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.8.</note> yet not ſimply as he is in his owne nature, becauſe hee is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and we ſhall be ſtill finite, though changed from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Thus we haue it made plaine, how God is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe no way can he be ſeene, as he is in his owne nature, of any creature, either with the eye of the body, or with the eye of the minde, in this life or in the life to come. It is onely the Sonne of God that hath that ſight of God his Father, for he is in the boſome of his Father: and the ſight that man or Angell, hath of God in heauen; is, by a mediate perſon, the Sonne of God. So then the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle in theſe words is briefly this; who is the eternall Sonne of God, of the ſame ſubſtance with his Father, and in whom being incarnate; God who is inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not to be ſeene either with the eye of the body, or with the eye of the minde in this life, or in the life to come, in his owne nature immediately hath made himſelfe known to vs to be moſt wiſe, iuſt and mercifull.</p>
                  <p>Now to the doctrine hence to be gathered: Firſt we are <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> to marke that the Apoſtle doth fetch his proofe of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of our redemption from the Godhead of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt is the firſt ground of our redemption.</note> that he is the eſſentiall image of God his father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſufficient and perfect Redeemer, that is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reaſon; Whence wee may conclude, that is the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt is the firſt ground of our redemption, it is not grounded firſt vpon the manhood of Chriſt, but vpon Ieſus Chriſt, God equall with the Father in Maieſty and glory. Yet we muſt remember that hee is our Mediatour, in reſpect of both nature diuine and humane, I will not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:490:107"/> enlarge the point hauing ſaid ſomthing of it before.</p>
                  <p>But for the vſe <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                     </label> in a word, it being ſo that the firſt ground of our redemption is the God-head of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the bloud of Chriſt ſtands firme and faſt for euer.</note> it muſt needs follow, that his bloud is a moſt pretious bloud, and our redemption made by that bloud muſt of neceſſity hold, and ſtand firme and faſt for euer, all the power of hel ſhall neuer be able to ouerturne it, if once we truly beleeue in Chriſt, we can neuer be vtterly caſt away.

We are further heere to marke, that the Apoſtle proouing Chriſt a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, by an argument from his God head, ſaith not in one word that he is God, but he deliuers it in theſe termes, that he is the image of the inuiſible God, a true and liuely repreſentation of God: ſetting out vnto vs his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, iuſtice and mercy.</p>

If many men and women were examined touching this point, though they profeſſe Chriſt and Chriſtian religion yet they would be found to know God no more then the very Heathen, who neuer heard of Chriſt. I dare bee bold to ſay, many there bee that haue onely a naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which all men haue by the light of nature, or ſuch as is gathered by the ſight of the creatures; and that no man may except againſt my ſpeech, and ſay this is hard that we ſhould ſo bee taxed, wee liue in a Church, where the knowledge of God is plainely taught, wee heare it ſounding in our eares, and we cannot be ſo ignorant, let them therefore heare how I prooue it from the mouth of the Apoſtle, Hee ſaith of them,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.34.</note> that ſaid let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow wee ſhall die. Awake to liue righteouſly, for ſome haue not the knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition is laid downe by the Apoſtle, and it is this, they that giue themſelues to eating and drinking and ſenſuality, and liue ſecurely in their ſinnes, haue not the knowledge of God, now the aſſumption may be made by too many in the world, and then the concluſion muſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:490:108"/> needs follow vpon the premiſes, that they haue no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God it they will haue it further proued; then hear the Lords owne Argument, he ſaith, verſe the 1. he had a controuerſie, he was to enter an action againſt his people for want of knowledge,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.2.</note> and how doth he prooue it? thus verſe 2. by ſwearing and lying, killing and ſtealing, and whoring they breake out, and bloud touched bloud. To go no further then the very firſt thing, is ſwearing an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the want of knowledge of God? (it muſt needs be ſo, God hauing manifeſted himſelfe moſt plainely a iuſt auenger of that ſinne) then many there bee that can tell themſelues, if they wil not palpably flatter themſelues that they are ſuch as know not God, their ſpeeches are more powdred with oathes, then their meat with ſalt, yea their children may witnes againſt them, whoſe tongues are no ſooner taught to ſpeake plainly, but they learne to ſweare moſt wickedly: a man may heare it from them playing in the ſtreets, and ſo may truly iudge of the parents that they haue no true knowledge of God themſelues, neither care they to teach others vnder them either by word or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to know the Lord. It is then plainely prooued againſt many, that will they, nill they, of force they muſt confeſſe they haue no true knowledge of God, then let ſuch as bee conuinced conſider that which was before deliuered, that they know not Chriſt by any ſauing knowledge, but as the deuills know him, and let them marke the ſequel, and that which followes vpon this, that they not knowing Chriſt, Chriſt will not know them, when he comes to diuide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſheepe &amp; the goates, he will not then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them for his, but ſay <hi>depart from me ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity I know you not.</hi> Which is a heauy ſentence and to be thought on with trembling, and let it ſtir vs vp to labour for the true knowlege of God as he hath manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Chriſt, a God of infinite wiſdome, iuſtice, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not a God all of mercy and no iuſtice, that is to ſet vp an idoll of our owne braine, to thinke there is mercy with

                  <p>Come we to the ſecond thing affirmed of Chriſt in this verſe, that hee is the firſt borne of euerie creature, and for the vnderſtanding of the words, wee muſt know that the Apoſtle calls Chriſt the firſt borne, by way of reſemblance and alluſion to the firſt borne in the olde teſtament. Now Chriſt is ſo called in a double reſpect,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> firſt, becauſe as the firſt borne were brought forth before the reſt of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſo Chriſt as God was begotten of the ſubſtance of his Father before any creature was made, or had being, he was begotten from al eternity after an vnſpeakeable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.1.</note> before the world was. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:490:110"/> the word was with God, and the word was God.</hi> When things created beganne to be, then he was, and ſo before all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures euen from eternitie, for time beganne together with the world, and before the creation was eternitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe as the firſt borne ſonne among the people of Iſrael, ſucceeded his Father in the Kingdome, and Prieſthood, and was Lord and Gouernour of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſo Chriſt was made heire of the world,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> and chiefe gouernour of Gods family, his children elected and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him; now heere we are to vnderſtand the words of the Apoſtle, in the firſt reſpect not in the ſecond, becauſe the purpoſe of the Apoſtle was here, to ſet out vnto vs, the eternity of Chriſt his God-head and not to ſpeake of him as God and man, for in that reſpect, namely, in reſpect of his manhood aſſumed vnto vnity of perſon with his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, he is reſembled to the firſt borne, as he hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Church,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 29.</note> therefore called the firſt borne among many brethren.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The Apoſtle in this verſe prooues his generall propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion layd downe ver. the 15. That Chriſt is the true eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, begotten of his Father from all eternity, this he prooueth by two arguments. Firſt, becauſe Chriſt is the creatour of all things. Secondly, becauſe all things were created and made for his glory. The firſt argument is laid downe in the firſt words, <hi>for by him were all things made,</hi> and that is reſumed and repeated in the latter end of the verſe: in which argument, is ſpeciall relation to the words of the former verſe, that he is <hi>the firſt borne of euery creature.</hi> For if all things were created by him, then it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he was before all things, and that he was not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as <hi>Arrian</hi> Heretickes hold, but begotten of his Father from euerlaſting. Now this argument is further layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, by a double difference of things created, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was not content to ſay in generall, that by Chriſt all things were created, but hee doth further particularize, and vnfold what he meanes by all things. Firſt, by a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of place, wherein things created are, heauen and earth; which are in heauen and which are in earth, then by difference of their quality, viſible and inuiſible, after this, followeth another amplification by ſpeciall inſtance, the Apoſtle inſiſting in one ſort of inuiſible creatures, namely
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:490:112"/> Angels, which he calles by theſe titles of honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Thrones or Dominions, Principalities or Powers;</hi> he hath made all inuiſible creatures, euen the moſt excellent inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures, the Angels, whether ye call them <hi>thrones &amp;c.</hi> and then repeats the generall, <hi>all things were created by him;</hi> and thus farre goeth the firſt argument. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is in the very laſt words <hi>(and for him)</hi> and theſe bee the parts of this verſe. Come we to ſpeake of the words, as they are layd downe by the holy Ghoſt, and firſt of the words <hi>(for by him were all things created)</hi> whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayth <hi>(by him)</hi> namely, by Chriſt: though that phraſe and forme of ſpeech applied to any worke,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſignifie the meanes, or inſtrument of working; yet heere we are not ſo to conceiue it, as that Chriſt was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inſtrument, or inferiour meanes of creating as the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Heretickes wickedly would haue concluded, but that by his ſubſtantiall power, and vertue equall to the power of God his Father, all things were created, <hi>Whatſoeuer the Father doth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.19.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſame things doth the Sonne alſo.</hi> And againe, we are not to vnderſtand theſe words <hi>(by him)</hi> as ſpoken excluſiuely, as ſhutting out God the Father and holy Ghoſt, for that is contrary to the firſt Article of our Creed, that God the Father is the Creatour of all things, and wee are to remember the rule, that <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra ſunt indiuiſa,</hi> and therefore the worke of creation, is a worke of the whole Trinity; but we are to conceiue of this, and of that in the firſt Article, as ſet downe onely to ſhew the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and manner of the creation, that God the Fathers, as he is the fountaine of the God-head, not temporall but ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, ſo as the firſt authour, he created all things by God the Sonne, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. All things were made by it, that is, by the Sonne, the ſubſtantiall Word of the Father, <hi>(crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)</hi> that is, which were not before, formed and made to be, and that of nothing, thus then are theſe words to bee conceiued: For by his ſubſtantiall power, equall to the power of God his Father, working together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:490:112"/> and the holy Ghoſt, were all things that were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, framed and made and that of nothing.</p>
                  <p>Now to the doctrine, firſt we are to marke the argument of the Apoſtle, that he prooues Chriſt to be true and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, by an argument from the creation, that he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, and therefore he is God eternall, whence it followeth directly and plainely, that the worke of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth manifeſtly euince and prooue the God-head, he <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> is God that creates; and backe againe,<note place="margin">The worke of creation is a plaine proofe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> hee that is able to create is God; for it is a property peculiar to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head incommunicable to create, it cannot bee giuen nor agree to any creature, Saint or Angell; no not to all the Saints and Angels, for that were to make them omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to giue being to any thing, that was nothing before, is proper to God.

                     <hi>and there is none other.</hi> How prooues he that verſe 7. <hi>I forme the light and create darkneſſe: I make peace and create euill: I the Lord doe all theſe things.</hi> And <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.11. he brings it as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt idols and falſe gods, to prooue them no gods, but meere vanities as he calles them, and ſubiect to deſtruction: <hi>thus</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſhall you ſay vnto them, the gods that haue not made the heauens and the earth, ſhall periſh from the earth, and from vnder the heauens,</hi> and verſe the 12. <hi>by way of oppoſition, hee hath made the earth, and eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſedome, and hath ſtretched out the heauens by his deſcretion.</hi>

It is our Sauiours argument,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.36.</note> that wee muſt not ſweare by our heads, becauſe they are his creatures, and not ours, wee are not able to make one haire white or blacke. But I will not further ſtand on that: let vs by this be led forward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Chriſt, as he is God, is able to vſe the meaneſt &amp; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> weakeſt things in the world to ouermaſter the ſtrongeſt,<note place="margin">Chriſt as he is God can vſe the meaneſt and weakeſt creatures to ouermaſter the ſtrongeſt.</note> as he could in the firſt creation of all things haue made the meaneſt creature the moſt glorious, ſo doubtleſſe hee can giue power at his pleaſure to the weakeſt to match and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the ſtrongeſt. We finde in the book of <hi>Exod.</hi> that he dealt with hard hearted &amp; rebellious <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by frogs and lice, and ſuch like meane and contemptible creatures: it had beene as eaſie for the Lord, when he turned duſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lice, to haue turned it into Lions, Beares, Wolues, and beaſts of exceeding greatneſſe and cruell fierceneſſe; but hee rather choſe to confound pride by weakneſſe, that his power might more appeare, and to ſhew that hee is able at his pleaſure to make the weakeſt creature to conquer and bring downe the pride and power of the ſtrongeſt. And to preſſe this a little further, let vs thinke of it to this purpoſe: and if the Lord can make ſuch meane creatures, as frogs, lice, &amp; flies, too ſtrong for a mightie kingdome, what reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then can any ſilly man or woman make againſt the Lords wrath, if they pull it vpon them by their ſinnes? his wrath can arme all the creatures in heauen and earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:490:117"/> vs, and giue power to the leaſt of them, to a flie, an haire, or the like, farre aboue any power of ours. Who then as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Nahu.</hi> 1.6. can ſtand before his wrath, or who can abide the fierceneſſe of his wrath? his wrath is powred out like fire, and the rockes are broken by him. Let hard hearted &amp; impenitent ſinners think vpon it, that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt could (if it had pleaſed him) haue made a ſilly worme a glorious Angell, and hee can vſe the meaneſt creature to bring downe the power of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, he can arme all creatures againſt vs. Let vs therefore learne to tremble before him: ſhall we prouoke him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not bring confuſion vpon our ſelues? he is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie creator, therfore able to bring infinite puniſhments vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs at his pleaſure. It is the exhortation of the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12 Prepare to meet thy God oh Iſrael, and hee builds his exhortation vpon this very ground, for loe hee that formeth the mountaines, and createth the windes, &amp; declareth vnto man what his thought is, which maketh the morning darkneſſe, and walketh vpon the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth, the Lord of hoaſts is his name: as if he had ſaid, God is able to create the windes, to forme the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to alter the courſe of nature, to make the morning darkneſſe, therefore he is able to make an eternall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thy confuſion; be therefore admoniſhed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet this mightie God. For the concluſion of this point,<note place="margin">Luk. 20.18.</note> remember Chriſt his owne ſpeech, that whoſoeuer ſhall fall vpon him ſhall be broken, and on whomſoeuer he ſhall fall, he ſhall grinde him to powder.</p>

This repetition as others in the Scripture is not idle or ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but for ſpeciall cauſes; Firſt to ſignifie that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had not ſpoken raſhly, but aduiſedly.

                  <p>I come to the ſecond thing, which is a third argument,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> proouing Chriſt to be God, in the words following <hi>(and in him all things conſiſt)</hi> the words are briefly thus to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that by the powerfull hand of Chriſt, all things created, are preſerued in their eſſence and ſtate, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in their ſubſtances, quantities, qualities, motions,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:490:125"/> and actions, ſo as if hee ſhould withdraw his hand they would all periſh and come to nothing, hence hee is ſaid to beare vp all things by his mighty word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and to be with his Father, as nouriſher of all things, <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.30. for we muſt not vnderſtand this, and the like places (as I haue often noted) excluſiuely, as ſhutting out the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God the Father, and of the holy Ghoſt, but that he together with the Father, and holy Ghoſt, doth power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerue all things: now heere, firſt we are to marke the argument of the Apoſtle, that he proues Chriſt to bee true and eternall God by the worke of preſeruation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the creation, that he is the preſeruer of all things, and therefore God. Whence it followes that the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">

Now for further vſe of this point, heere comes a queſtion to be ſcanned, that ſeeing, our preſeruation in regard of being and ſtate, is by the mighty power of God, and we finde in the Scripture, that ſome haue beene preſerued in reſpect of body, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull hand of God, extraordinarily, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons denne, <hi>Eliah</hi> forty dayes and forty nights, with a courſe cake and pot of water.</p>

When the people of Iſrael are at the red ſea, and ſee no way how to eſcape their enemies, then they may look that the Lord will deuide the ſea, and giue them paſſage tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it; when <hi>Daniel</hi> is caſt into the Lyons den, hee may then expect Angels to come and cloſe the Lyons mouths, the Scripture is plentifull in examples of this kinde, but on the other ſide, when ordinary meanes are to be had, then it is contempt of Gods ordinance and preſumption not to

                  <p>From the words thus vnderſtood we may firſt conclude, that Chriſt onely is the head of the vniuerſall Catholike Church, for though euery King may in good ſenſe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the head of the particular viſible Church of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is a body diſtinct from the whole Church, yet of the whole Church, being one bodie conſiſting of all the members of it, there can be but one head, &amp; that is Chriſt, becauſe he onely is knit to Gods elect, called and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by myſticall vnion, he only giues ſpirituall life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the members of the Church, yea, the Papiſts themſelues. againſt whom I note this, who ſay, that the

And ſo I leaue this point, and come to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that the Apoſtle ſets down that relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and his Church, by this ſimilitude that he is as an head, and the Church as a body, wee are taught that there is a moſt neere vnion, and coniunction betweene Chriſt and his Church, euen as neere as there is betweene the head of a man and his body, yea more neere, for the <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And then they containe a Second reaſon to prooue Chriſt his ſufficiency to redeeme vs and the argument is from the eternall decree and good pleaſure of his Father, that he had ſo decreed, that Chriſt ſhould be a ſufficient redeemer which is propounded vnder the matter of his ſufficiency (namely) all fulneſſe dwelling in him, that it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell and therefore he is a ſufficient redeemer, and this is the connexion &amp; general ſcope of the Apoſtle in theſe words. We find the ſentence in the originall thus laid downe, for it pleaſed that in him the word (father) is not expreſſed, but yet that word which is heere rendred (pleaſed) being the ſame word that is vſed by the Euangeliſt Mat. 3.17.<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and reueale the good pleaſure of the Father, it may well be referred to the eternall decree of God the Father,

                  <p>Now heere much might bee ſpoken of the neceſſity of Gods eternall decree, which is the force of the Apoſtles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the Father decreed it in his eternall councell, that Chriſt ſhould be a perfect redeemer, and therefore it muſt needs come to paſſe, and likewiſe heere wee might ſpeake of the contingent and neceſſary comming to paſſe of things of the neceſſity of coaction and infallibility, but I paſſe by theſe things.</p>

                  <p>This verſe is a further amplification of the Apoſtles ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond argument, whereby he proues Chriſt a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the ground of this alſo is from the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of his Father, for that muſt be reſumed (it pleaſed the Father) (by him to reconcile) the matter, ſubſtance and generall propoſition laid downe in this verſe, is this.</p>
                  <p>That it pleaſed the Father, that the death of Chriſt in whom all fulneſſe of merit is found, ſhould bee a full and perfect attonement and reconciliation of all things to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>This is generally propounded in the firſt words, and by him &amp;c. and then it is further explaned with ſome change and variety of phraſe, and withall there is mention made of the ſpecial meanes of reconciliation (namely) the death of Chriſt, and that his bloudy death vpon the croſſe in thoſe words (and to ſet at peace by the bloud of his croſſe.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:490:148"/> and meritorious cauſe of reconciliation as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. Corin. 5.19. God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe, not imputing their ſinnes vnto them, (to reconcile) that is to ſet at one and to make of enemies friends as the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 5.10. When wee were enemies we were reconciled to God, by the death of his ſonne taking away the cauſe of enmity and difference, (namely) ſin, for ſo long as that remained vntaken away, no friendſhip could be betweene God and man, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue it in the place before named 2. Corin. 15.16. not imputing their ſinnes vnto them (all things) (that is) all things in heauen and earth that he had appointed to be reconciled (to himſelfe) theſe words haue reference to the word Father in the verſe before. Thus then we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue theſe words, it pleaſed the Father by Chriſt not as an inſtrument but as the meritorious cauſe to make al that he had appointed to be reconciled euen at one and at peace with himſelfe, remouing al cauſe of enmity between them and himſelfe.</p>

The ſacrifices of the law were often to be offered, but the ſacrifice of Chriſt only once. The Prieſts of the law had many iteratiue &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moratiue ſacrifices of Chriſt his death, therefore we haue not ſo now: this is the oppoſition of the holy ghoſt, and this falles to the ground, if there be any iteration of Chriſt his ſacrifice; againe, the diſtinction is abſurd and fooliſh, that Chriſt ſhould offer himſelfe vppon the croſſe after a bloudy manner, and in the Sacrament after an vnbloudy manner, for the ſacrifice and offering of Chriſt &amp; his death and ſuffering, which cannot be without effuſion of bloud, are made by the holy ghoſt all one, Chriſt cannot be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without dying and ſuffering,<note place="margin">Heb: 9.25.27.</note> therfore this diſtinction was neuer knowne to the holy ghoſt, neither hath it any footing in the word: it remaines a truth, that Chriſt his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice once offered vpon the croſſe, is moſt abſolute, and of infinite merit and vertue to reconcile vs vnto God, and therefore other reall ſacrifices whether repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue (as they call them) or vnbloudy whatſoeuer, are needleſſe and vaine, and there is not in the Sacrament of the Supper, any reall externall propitiatorie ſacrifice, as the Papiſts groſſely hold and teach.</p>
                  <p>The next thing wee haue to marke is this, in that the Apoſtle makes the ſpeciall meanes of reconciliation betweene God and his choſen by taking away of their

                  <p>I will therefore labour firſt to ſtrengthen the truth now deliuered, by ſome reaſons out of the word of god, &amp; then anſwer ſuch things as are commonly obiected againſt it.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, it is the property of true vertue not onely to <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>To beginne well and not to continue brings ſhame and therefore it is no true vertue, for the crowne of that is glory not ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to vrge this duty, it will not be amiſſe to ſhew ſome ſpeciall meanes how wee may continue in goodneſſe begun in vs, for the meanes to that purpoſe are not onely generall, as diligent hearing and reading of the word, prayer, Sacraments, conference, good company, &amp;c. but alſo more ſpeciall, ſuch as ſerue peculiarly for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and preſeruation of ſome particular grace begun in vs, for example.</p>
                  <p>A ſpeciall meanes for continuance of humilitie begun in our hearts,<note place="margin">Special means for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie begun in vs.</note> is a continuall meditation of our own vilenes and corruption, a looking on the good things of other men as well as on our owne good things, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.4.

                  <p>A through examination without partiall affection of the reports other men make of vs.</p>

                  <p>Firſt to labour to haue a liuely ſence and feeling of the ſweeteneſſe of the word. For the more we feele the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it, the more wee ſhall bee enflamed with a loue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to it.</p>

                  <p>Thus we finde that <hi>Dauids</hi> loue to the word was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and continued.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.96.</note> I haue ſeen an ende of all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but thy commaundement is exceeding large; then it followes in the next verſe, <hi>Oh how loue I thy Law,</hi> it is my meditation continually.

                  <p>Now touching the continuance of loue to the worde, men haue need a litle to be rowſed, for now generally men begin to decline and to fall from their firſt loue,<note place="margin">Reuel. 2.4.</note> as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſpeakes.

                  <p>Againe, conſider that his condition is better that neuer <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Motiue. </seg>2</label> begunne to doe well, then his who once begun, and then falls wholly from it. For that is like a relapſe into ſome great ſickneſſe, which wee know is moſt dangerous, it is the doctrine of Chriſt himſelfe,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.45.</note> that the laſt ſtate of that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:490:171"/> man is worſe then the beginning, and there is reaſon for it, for then followes hardneſſe, impenitencie, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waight of condemnation, yea it is dangerous to fall from grace though it be but in part, it made <hi>Paul</hi> in doubt of the Galathians <hi>cap.</hi> 4.20. If then we would not looſe our labour, and miſſe our reward; if wee would not fall into ſuch a ſtate, as is farre worſe than if wee had neuer begun to doe well, bringing with it hardneſſe of heart, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation, let as many as haue any loue to the word, or loue to their brethren, any zeale of Gods glory, or other grace begunne in them, labour by all good meanes to continue and increaſe in the ſame; ſhall the wicked bee more conſtant in wickedneſſe, then wee in the feare of the Lord?

                  <p>The next thing wee haue to marke, is the order of the words of the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the manner of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the faith. He ſaith grounded and ſtabliſhed.</p>

                  <p>And conſider yet further, if our worke of loue bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſluggiſh it is more then a probable argument wee are yet a ſleepe in a carnall ſecurity, and doe but dreame of Chriſt and of the remiſſion of our ſins, for faith worketh by loue, and ſuch as faith is, ſuch will loue be,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> and ſuch as loue is we may gather faith to bee, if then we bee ſlothfull in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duties of loue to our brethren, it will ſeale vp vnto vs a fearefull concluſion, that our faith is indeed but a fancy, and our hope ſutable, ſuch as in the ende will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and make vs aſhamed.</p>

                  <p>Obſerue we, that the Apoſtle ſaith, hee was a Miniſter of the Church, the body of Chriſt; hee ſayth not that hee was a Miniſter at large, the word Miniſter being a word of relation, but hee ſets it downe with this correlatiue the Church, that his miniſtery had ſpeciall reference to the Church of Chriſt, and to the true members of Chriſt, and not to any other; Hence ariſeth this poynt of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <p>Now to the laſt words of this verſe, which are an expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles meaning, what wee are to vnderſtand by the riches of the Goſpell, and containe alſo a fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perſwade the Coloſſians to continue in the faith, the argument is from the matter and ſubſtance of the Goſpell, that the matter and ſubſtance of the Goſpell, &amp; the ſubiect of all true preaching of the Goſpell is Chriſt our Sauiour and redeemer, by whom we looke for life and glory, and therefore they ought to continue ſtedfaſt in the profeſſion of the trueth of the Goſpell; that is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and drift of the Apoſtle in theſe words, and of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next verſe, <hi>whom wee preach</hi> the wordes are <hi>(which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory)</hi> the worde (which) doth plainely ſhew in the originall to what it hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (namely) to riches, and ſo the worde <hi>(Riches)</hi> may very well bee ſupplied <hi>(Chriſt in you)</hi> for the better conceauing of theſe wordes,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> wee muſt vnderſtand that Chriſt his beeing in vs, is not locall or corporall, but ſpirituall and ſupernaturall. Chriſt is in vs after a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner, (namely) by his ſpirite in reſpect of Chriſt himſelfe, and by faith in reſpect of vs, for theſe are the ſpirituall bounds by which Chriſt is knit to vs, and we to him, and wee finde Chriſt his beeing in vs expreſſed in Scripture on this manner, that he dwelleth in vs by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1. Iohn 2 27. and againe by Faith, Epheſ. 3.17. and that we miſtake not Chriſt his being in vs, we muſt know further, that the Spirit of Chriſt is in vs, not in eſſence and ſubſtance; but in operation, he working in vs both to our
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:490:208"/> iuſtification and ſanctification, hee both applying Chriſt vnto vs, and quickning vs by his grace to newneſſe of life, <hi>(hope of glory)</hi> that is, by whom wee certainely hope and looke for glory in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Hence is Chriſt called our hope, 1. Tim. 1.1. Thus then the words are to be conceaued.</p>
                  <p>Which riches is Chriſt being in you by the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, and by the operation of the Spirit of Chriſt by whom we certainely looke for glory in heauen.</p>
                  <p>From the argument heere vſed by the Apoſtle take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a groſſe error of popiſh doctrine.<note place="margin">A groſſe error of the Papiſts confuted.</note> The Papiſts teach that the Goſpell is nothing elſe in effect, but the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> made perfect, the law written in mens hearts by the holy Ghoſt, if this were true, then ſhould the Law and the Goſpell be all one in ſubſtance, &amp; differing only in degree of perfection, then ſhould Chriſt haue bin reuealed in the Law which is falſe, the Law neuer knew Chriſt nor faith in Chriſt, the mediator, God &amp; man; the Apoſtle heer makes Chriſt the ſubſtance of the Goſpell, and therein placeth the riches and excellency of the Goſpell, which indeede were no preferment at all, if the Law and the Goſpel were all one, it is ſufficient to haue named this. The next thing we haue to marke is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, the riches of the Goſpell is not onely Chriſt, but Chriſt in vs. The Goſpell doth propound and ſet before vs Chriſt, not onely in his owne perſon, nature and office, but alſo in vs by the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of faith, and application of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Hence wee may gather, that to whomſoeuer Chriſt is a Sauiour, he is not a Sauiour altogether out of himſelfe, hee is ſo a Sauiour to euery one, as hee is propounded and ſet forth in the Goſpell, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:490:209"/> and giuing allowance and ſtrength to a Popiſh opinion, (namely) this, that Chriſt is a Sauiour in vs, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating and giuing merit to our workes, and making them meritorious as the Papiſts teach, this indeed is to make Chriſt not an abſolute and perfect Sauiour by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as wee are taught Hebrewes 7.25. but onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument by whom wee muſt ſaue our ſelues, and there is no trueth in this, becauſe Chriſt is not one with vs, by perſonall vnion which is the ground of all merit, euen in Chriſt himſelfe, when therefore I ſay to whomſoeuer Chriſt is a Sauiour, hee is not a Sauiour altogether, out of himſelfe, my meaning is according to the trueth of the word of God, that hee is a Sauiour vnto him, not onely by the merite of his death and obedience,<note place="margin">How Chriſt is a Sauior in ſome ſort in vs</note> procuring pardon of ſinne, and right to life eternall, but alſo by his efficacy by his effectuall working in him by his Spirite, working faith in his heart to apprehend his merite, and purging his heart from corruption, and turning it from ſinne to God, and for proofe of this wee haue ſome pregnant places of Scripture <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14 ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Chriſt gaue himſelfe for vs, that hee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs from all iniquity, and purge vs to be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people vnto himſelfe, zealous of good workes, not onely to bee a redeemer from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, but alſo from the corruption of ſin, 1.

Eccleſ. 9.10. the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſayth, all that thine hand ſhall finde to doe, doe it, with all thy power: not onely doe it, but doe it, with all thy power; as if hee had ſayd, follow the workes of thy vocation, and employ all the powers of the minde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the diſcharging of it faithfully, <hi>Paul</hi> biddes him that ruleth, not onely to rule, but with diligence, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man that hath an office or calling, to wayt on it with care and diligence, Rom. 12.7.8. the reaſons of thus duty are two. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly, becauſe the Lord hath given vnto man both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a body and a minde, that both theſe might be vſed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the workes of his calling, that he ſhould do them not onely with his body, for ſo do bruit beaſts, the oxe &amp; the aſſe; but man muſt doe the workes of his calling with his body and with earneſt intention of his minde, and ſo with care and diligence.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, our diligence in doing the duties of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, muſt bee with reſpect to the will and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, for diligence is required by his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and wee are to bee diligent in performing

The example of our Apoſtle in this place doth teach thus much, hee was called to preach the Goſpell, that hee might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſome perfect in Chriſt Ieſus, and to that end did he employ his whole ſtrength and endeauour; ſo muſt we in our particular places and callings; for example, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a family, he that is called to bee a maſter and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ouer others, muſt not onely in a family be diligent, in gouerning his wife, children and ſeruants, for that may bee done for his owne profit and commodity, which (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) is not vnlawfull, a man may reape the fruit of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of thoſe that be vnder him;<note place="margin">Pſal. 129.2.</note> but that muſt not be the ſcope and drift of his diligent adminiſtration and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: but hee muſt therein driue at the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good of the bodies and ſoules of thoſe that bee vnder him; that is the end of his particular calling.

                  <q>That they ſhould walke and grow ſtrongly and formely in Chriſt, ſo as no temptation or affliction ſhould be able to remooue them from him; euen as trees well and deepely rooted, and as houſes ſet vpon ſure, firme and immooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foundations, which neither winde nor weather can ouerturne and throw downe.</q>
                  <p>Now here paſſing by that doctrine of conſtancy in faith of which I ſhall haue more fit occaſion to ſpeake when I come to handle the next words, the firſt thing wee are to marke is, that the Apoſtle was not content to exhort the Coloſſians to walke on in Chriſt, but he addes further <hi>roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and built in him,</hi> that they ſhould walk in Chriſt, as thoſe that are rooted and built in him, hence the Apoſtle by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication doth <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The next thing hence offered to our conſideration, is from the word heere vſed <hi>(abounding or exceeding)</hi> for the word ſignifies not, that there can bee any exceſſe of faith, or any other grace, as the Papiſts writing on Acts. 17.22.

                  <p>In this verſe the Apoſtle returnes againe to that generall propoſition.</p>
                  <p>That all things out of Chriſt in the matter of ſaluation are meere deceit and vanity; and here he comes to a more particular handling of it, laying before the Coloſſians the ſpeciall meanes vſed by ſeducers to deceiue them, and to draw them from Chriſt, and to thruſt, vpon them other things beſides Chriſt, that is the generall matter contained in this verſe.</p>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:490:276"/>
                  <p>Now this matter is expreſſed &amp; laid out in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.

Let vs not then receiue things offered vnto vs in that manner hand ouer head but with examination. I deny not all vſe of philoſophy, there may be good vſe of it in diuinity.</p>
                  <p>And I will now briefely ſhew how farre foorth philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie is pernicious and hurtfull to religion, and how farre foorth it is not.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore know that philoſophy &amp; the learning of the heathen is hurtfull to religion, in that it puts downe ſome things vtterly falſe and againſt the word of God as the eternity of this world, that chiefe happineſſe is found in ciuill vertue, that vertue is nothing elſe but a mediocrity or moderation of naturall affection without renouation or change of them by grace and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is pernicious to religion, in that ſuch things as haue their truth in philoſophy and nature are abuſed to ouerturne or corrupt ſome truth in religion, for example, that of nothing, nothing is made; it is true in nature and reaſon, but it is falſe in diuinity and religion, that teaching vs that God made all things of nothing, that from a priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an habit there is no returne, hath ſome truth in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, but in religion it holds not true, becauſe from death to life there is a returne, and there ſhall be a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body; that the iuſtice and righteouſneſſe by which a man is iuſt and righteous is formall inherent in himſelfe not in another, as wiſedome or learning is in him that is wiſe or learned is true in philoſophy, but falſe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, becauſe the iuſtice and righteouſneſſe by which we are iuſt and righteous in the ſight of God, is not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in vs, but it is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed vnto vs, many other inſtances might be giuen, but theſe may ſufficiently cleere it, that philoſophy is dangerous to

Cor. 11.14. ſaith the Apoſtle, doth not nature it ſelfe teach you, that if a man haue long haire, it is a ſhame vnto him, Chriſt himſelfe ſends his followers to the foules of the aire, &amp; to the lillies of the field to learne that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent point of the prouidence of God, in the preſeruation of them; the booke of <hi>Iob</hi> is full of arguments from things natural to manifeſt and make knowen the infinite wiſdom &amp; power of God, &amp; there is no doubt, but that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> being inſtructed in the wiſdome of the Aegyptians and Caldeans they made good vſe of that knowledge, let no man then ſimply condemne philoſophy &amp; all liberall arts &amp; ſciences as ſome fooliſhly do but ſo far forth as phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy puts down things vtterly falſe, or as the rules of it are abuſed to ouerthrow or corrupt ſome truth in religion.</p>
                  <p>Let vs learne to profit by our knowledge of any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing, let our knowledge of a thing naturall,<note place="margin">We are to profit by our knowledge of natural things</note> ſerue as a ſtep to aſcend by, to the knowledge and conſideration of ſome things heauenly and ſpirituall; for example we know that the eye hath a faculty and power of ſeeing. Let vs thereby be led forward to conſider that heere is an eye in heauen that ſees more.</p>
                  <p>That in God the creator &amp; maker of the eye, there is a power of ſeeing all things. Thus did <hi>Dauid</hi> reaſon, Pſ. 94.9. he that formed the eye ſhall he not ſee, he riſeth vp from a

This ought to lead vs a long to conſider of a iudgement to come, that there ſhall be a time when God will bring all to iudgement. Euen our meate, drink &amp; apparell, are to put vs in mind of the neceſſitie of the foode of our ſoules, and the inward hablements and cloathing of the ſoule, yea, the graſſe of the field, and the flowers of our gardens flouriſhing for a time, and then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding away, are to put vs in minde of the ſhort continuance and fading ſtate of our liues, thus doing wee ſhall walke in earthly things and haue heauenly mindes, and make a right vſe of our philoſophy, euen of our contemplation &amp; knowledge of naturall things.</p>

                  <p>This verſe is an anticipation or preuention of a ſecret obiection. For the Colſſioans might ſay, you tell vs that wee are compleate in Chriſt, but there bee ſome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that ſay, wee Gentiles wanting circumciſion are vncleane, and therefore not perfect in Chriſt, this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle meetes withall in this verſe, and ſaith, that in Chriſt they alſo were circumciſed: and in this verſe the Apoſtle beginnes to reaſon againſt the third meanes of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vſed by ſeducers ſpoken of verſe the 6.

                  <q>You are by the power of Chriſt inwardly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, therefore you need not outward circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the fleſh.</q>

Now may ſome ſay, this is not to the purpoſe, this prooues not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumciſion to be therefore needleſſe, becauſe they were inwardly circumciſed; if this be a ſufficient argument againſt outward circumciſion; then this alſo is a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt outward baptiſme, that ſuch as are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhed by the holy Ghoſt, need not outward baptiſme, but we ſee that to be contrary by the practiſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> who commanded that <hi>Cornelius</hi> his family and others met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, being inwardly baptized by the holy Ghoſt, ſhould be alſo baptized with water in the name of the Lord Ieſus, therefore this ſeemes to be no ſound and ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vſed by the Apoſtle.</p>

<pb n="583" facs="tcp:490:303"/> and ſealing vp vnto them their inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall circumciſion: this exception the Apoſtle preuents in this verſe, ſhewing that the Coloſſians had an outward ſigne and ſeale of their inward circumciſion (namely) baptiſme which by Chriſt his inſtitution ſucceeded cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, &amp; that in ſtead of being circumciſed, they were baptized, and ſo had the outward ſigne with the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</p>

                     <hi>(which raiſed him from the dead)</hi> as if he had ſaid who by that working power of his raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, the words are cleare, and neede no further expoſition; onely leſt wee ſtumble at ſome places of Scripture which ſeeme not to agree with this, that God raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, in that it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp himſelfe, Iohn</hi> 10.18.

<pb n="606" facs="tcp:490:316"/> it ſelfe. Hence it is that the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. ſets out the naturall man, not onely to be void of actuall knowledge of God, and of all good things, but voide of all potentiall knowledge of them, hee cannot by any power inherent in himſelfe come to the knowledge of them the naturall man (ſaith he) perceiueth not the things of the Spirit of God; there is his actuall want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge touching ſpirituall things, and leaſt ſome ſhould ſay this comes to paſſe, becauſe hee doth neglect or contemn them, hee neuer labours to know them; the Apoſtle addes further, neither can hee know them, let him labor neuer ſo much; there is his want of power to know them, the reaſon followeth, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a plaine euidence and proofe, that a man in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtate is ſo vnder ſinne, as a dead man is vnder death; ſinne holds a naturall man as faſt vnder the power of it; as death doth a dead man vnder the power of it, he cannot moue his minde to think, his will to like, and affect any thing that is good; he is as a dead man in reſpect of any thing that is good: the Scripture is both plaine &amp; plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <label type="milestone">

                  <q>That remiſſion of ſinnes is the ground of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall quickning both of Iewes and Gentiles dead in ſinnes by nature.</q>

                  <p>Firſt, heere obſerue wee the context that the Apoſtle makes the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes the ground of their quickning, and ſo he ſpeakes in the time paſt, hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen vs, as if he had ſaid,

                  <p>Now that full ſatisfaction is not in plaine terms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but is laide downe in the proofe of it, and was proued by an argument taken from the diſanulling or cancelling of a bill or bond which did witneſſe our guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of ſinne, and by which wee ſtood bound ouer to the puniſhment of ſinne, that Chriſt hath cancelled that bond, and therefore fully ſatisfied for our ſinnes, that is the ſumme and ſubſtance of this verſe.</p>

                  <p>Now from hence it i is clare that Chriſt hath not onely <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The reaſon and ground of this is very plaine (namely) this, Chriſt hath not onely paide euery iot of the principal debt of Gods choſen, but hath alſo fully anſwered the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture and penalty that did lye againſt them, for the breach of that bond of the law of God (namely) the curſe of the law, for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.

                  <p>We know it in common experience, that we vſe not to deliuer vp or cancell their bond, till the whole debt bee payde, and they bee fully ſatisfied, if but halfe the debt or three quarters of it be paid, and not all in ſuch ſort, as the bonde requireth, men ſtill retaine the bond in full ſtrength and vertue, but if the bond bee deliuered vp or cancelled, that argues full contentment, and full ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:490:325"/> ſo is it betweene God and his choſen. Chriſt their ſuerty who vndertooke the payment of their debt to God his Father, hath paid the debt, and cancelled the bond, &amp; therefore hath fully ſatisfied for them; it is moſt abſurde and groſſe to thinke, there is any thing vnſatisfied, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing left for them to pay, the bond of their debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cancelled, eſpecially the bond being in the hands of God, who knowes whether any part of the debt bee lefte vnpaide; and is able to keepe the bond in his hands, if it bee not fully ſatisfied, indeed if the bond had beene in mens hands, it might happily haue beene gotten from them by violence or fraud, but the bond being in the hands of God, no ſuch thing can bee feared or ſuſpected, therefore he deliuering the bond into Chriſt his hands, &amp; ſuffering him to cancell it, it is a plaine and inuincible eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that hee is fully ſatisfied for the ſinnes of his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and they neede not patch or peece out that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by Chriſt, by any thing they can doe or ſuffer, as the Papiſts doe groſſely imagine.</p>

                  <p>It is all one with this, that their ſinnes are faſtned and nailed to the Croſſe, for wee ſee the Apoſtle ioines theſe together, blotting out, taking away, and faſtning to the Croſſe, as all comming to one purpoſe; wickedly, and therefore moſt iniuriouſly deale the Papiſts with vs, in charging vs to make a iuſtified man, but as a whited tombe faire without and foule within, and why ſo?

                  </p>
                  <p>Come wee now to the very laſt words of this Verſe, wherein (as I ſaid) is implied the meanes by which Chriſt cancelled the handwriting that was againſt vs (namely) <hi>his Croſſe,</hi>

                  <p>We are heere firſt to marke, that the Apoſtle doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the remouall, and the taking away of the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that was againſt vs, not to the life of Chriſt, but to his death; not to his actiue obedience, but to his paſſiue, to his ſuffering death on the Croſſe.

                  <p>Labour then to ſee thy particular ſins, and to ſee them together with the curſe due vnro them, that ſo thou maiſt be humbled and find thy ſelfe ſtand in need of the blood of Chriſt, this is the way to prepare thy heart for the worke of faith; and if thy heart be thus prepared and humbled, no doubt the Lord will worke faith in thee, to apprehend the merit of Chriſt his death for the pardon of thy ſins and thou ſhalt be freed from the curſe of the Law, and then thou comming to the Sacrament ſhalt to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort find thy faith in the bloud of Chriſt ſtrengthened and confirmed; and the Sacrament ſhall be to thee a ſeale of that righteouſneſſe that is by faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

                  <p>That is the generall meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this Verſe.</p>

                  <p>As firſt, that Chriſt ſpoiled the Principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; the word tranſlated <hi>ſpoiled,</hi> doth properly ſignifie ſtripped or made naked, and being heere applyed to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ouercome by Chriſt, it ſignifieth, that hee diſarmed them, puld off their armour, tooke from them all their weapons, and left them naked and ſpoiled of all power to hurt.</p>

                  <q>And hath diſarmed the Deuill and his Angels who are mighty and powerfull in the children of diſobedience, and taken from them their weapons, and left them as it were naked, and voide of all meanes to doe hurt.</q>
                  <p>Firſt obſerue wee heere in generall the Apoſtles ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the effect of Chriſt his death on the croſſe, hee ſaith that Chriſt, by his death hath not onely cancelled the hand-writing that was againſt vs, but (which is more) hath vanquiſhed the Diuell and his Angels, thus the Apoſtle goes on from the leſſer to the greater, and from the greater concludes the leſſer.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt hauing ſpoiled the principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hath certainely cancelled the hand-writing of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Come we to a more ſpecial conſideration of the words, and firſt conſider we the word <hi>(ſpoyled)</hi> the Apoſtle ſayth, Chriſt hath ſpoyled the principalities and powers, that is, as we haue heard before, hath ſtripped or diſarmed them, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="644" facs="tcp:490:335"/> ſo much is tendred to vs vnder the word <hi>(ſpoiled)</hi> and we are to conſider it; and that we miſtake it not, but may rightly conceiue this doctrine, we muſt conſider what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the Diuell had againſt Gods choſen before the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">What power the Diuell had againſt Gods choſen before the death of Chriſt.</note> and how that power is taken away by Chriſt his death; for the vnderſtanding of this know we, that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> by naturall generation are guilty of their firſt ſinne and borne vncleane ſinners, and the iuſtice of God is ſuch, that where there is guiltineſſe of ſinne there is damnation due, all then being guilty of ſinne deſeruing damnation, the Diuell hee ſtands before God day and night, requiring euen by the iuſtice of God that all ſhould be damned in hell for euer; Heerein then ſtands the power of the Diuell againſt Gods choſen, he had power to accuſe them in regard of their guiltineſſe of ſinne, and had power vnder a certaine right of Gods iuſtice (for the Lord cannot deny iuſtice and right becauſe hee cannot deny himſelfe) to require their damnation, this power the Diuell had againſt Gods choſen before the death of Chriſt. Now this power is taken away by Chriſt his death, on this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods choſen is taken away.</note>The Lord Ieſus tooke all the ſinnes and guiltineſſe of Gods choſen vpon him, and did beare them in his body on the tree, he ſuffered all the wrath and torments due for the ſame, and ſo with his owne precious bloud waſhed them and made them cleane from all guilt, and they being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and made cleane from guiltineſſe and ſinne, all the Diuels power to accuſe and require ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt them is taken away.</p>
                  <p>Thus we are eſpecially to vnderſtand this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt by his death hath taken from the Diuell and his Angels their power to hurt Gods choſen.</p>
                  <p>And this is chiefely intended by the Apoſtle in this, when he ſaith, Chriſt hath ſpoiled the Diuell and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but withall wee are further to vnderſtand that Chriſt by his death hath taken away the Diuels power to hurt

                  <p>Thus then conceiue we this doctrine.</p>
                  <q>That Chriſt by his death hath taken from the Diuell and his Angels their power to accuſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſentence of condemnation againſt Gods choſen; yea, their power to hurt any of Gods choſen either by temptation or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in regard of right and title, and certaine hope of life and ſaluation is taken away.</q>
                  <p>That is the doctrine, and to manifeſt this to bee a trueth conſider we theſe places of Scripture; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3, 15. wee haue it in the promiſe and promulgation of the Goſpell by God himſelfe, that the ſeed of the woman (that is) Chriſt ſhould giue him a deadly blow, breake his power and ſtrength, ſo as he ſhould neuer bee able to recouer it, and that hee ſhould onely bruiſe the heele of Chriſt (that is) only touch and try ſome weake members of Chriſt by many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but not be able to hurt them <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. we are taught that this promiſe was accompliſhed by the death of Chriſt, and that Chriſt through death deſtroied him that had the power of death (that is) the Diuell, and deliuered them which for feare of death were all their life time ſubiect to bondage, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.10.11. after the battell betweene <hi>Michael</hi> and the great Dragon (that is) betweene Chriſt

                     <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>That Chriſt by his death not onely ouercame the deuil and his Angels and ſtripped them of all power to hurt Gods choſen, but in his death he got himſelfe honour and glory ouer the Deuill, and he did as Conquerours vſe to

                  <p>Now from the matter of this powerfull iniunction, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, let no man condemne you in meat and drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the newe <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> moone, or of the Sabboth dayes; wee may eaſily gather that it is the nature of an erroneous ſpirit, of a falſe teacher, to iudge and condemne men, and that chiefely for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things<note place="margin">It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of falſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teachers to iudge &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne men chiefely for the vſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things.</note> in reſpect of meate, drinke, obſeruation of dayes and the like.

                  <p>The next thing offered to our conſideration from this iniunction is the inſtance heere giuen by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hee ſayth, let no man condemne you, and hee doth inſtance in meate and drinke, hence wee may take vp this concluſion.</p>
                  <p>That through Chriſt we haue free liberty in meat and <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Among the Iewes before the comming of Chriſt there was a difference of meates; ſome were cleane, and ſome were vncleane and forbidden, wee may read of them Leuiticus eleuenth, thorow out, and Deutro. 14, from verſe foure, to the end of the twenty &amp; one, but now ſince the death of Chriſt all kinds of meat and drinke are left to our liberty, that difference is taken away, and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. To the pure all things are pure, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14 I know ſaith the Apoſtle, and am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through the Lord Ieſus that there is nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane of it ſelfe, but vnto him that iudgeth any thing vncleane to him it is vncleane, and Verſe 20. all things indeede are pure. The reaſon of this is plaine, before the comming of Chriſt ſome meates were cleane and ſome vncleane, to ſignifie a difference betweene Iewe and Gentile, and the Iewe ſhould not communicate with the Gentile, but now by Chriſt that partition wall is broken downe, and of two they are made one in him, Epheſ. 2.14.15.

                  <p>This verſe hath reſpect to the verſe immediatly forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a further confirmation of it by a new argument, and in it is alſo couched an anſwer to a ſecret exception, that falſe teachers might take againſt the Apoſtles concluſion in the verſe before; for happily they might except againſt him, and ſay: is not the choice of meats, and obſeruation of ſolemne feaſts, new moones, and the vſe of other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies among the Iewes, a thing commanded of God, why then ſhould they be neglected?</p>
                  <p>To this the Apoſtle doth infold an anſwer in the words of this verſe, and it is this. That they were indeede com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, but onely to this ende, to ſhadow out Chriſt to come, and at his comming to ceaſe and haue an
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:490:351"/> end; and ſo the Apoſtles argument for confirmation of his conluſion is here taken from the end and vſe of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law, and may thus beframed.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law were appointed by God to prefigure and ſhadow out Chriſt to come.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Chriſt being now exhibited and come in the fleſh there is no more vſe of theſe ceremonies they haue ended their office in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In this Verſe more ſpecially we haue,</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, becauſe as a ſhaddow is a thing without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and formally by it ſelfe a meane accident: ſo the rites and ceremonies of the law taken by themſelues, were empty ſhewes (of good things to come) (that is) of Chriſt to come, of the miſteries and benefits of Chriſt, as recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, iuſtification, remiſſion of ſinnes, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of conſcience, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(But the body is in Chriſt)</hi> The words are, but the body is of Chriſt, the meaning is, but Chriſt is the body of thoſe ſhadowes (that is) the ſubſtance and truth of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:490:351"/> hee did truelie performe and exhibite thoſe thinges which they ſhadowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus then brieflie conceiue wee the words of this verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſayd.</p>
                  <p>Which ceremonies before ſpoken of and all other of like ſort, are but an obſcure reſemblance, and being taken by themſelues are but an empty ſhew of Chriſt to come, &amp; of the myſteries &amp; benefits of Chriſt, Chriſt is the ſubſtance &amp; truth of them, he truly performing and exhibiting thoſe things which they did prefigure and ſhadow out.</p>

                  <p>That the end and vſe of legall ceremonies was to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out Chriſt to co come. And therefore Chriſt beeing now come, there is no more vſe of them it plainly teacheth vs the abrogation of the vſe of all ſignificant and ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceremonies of <hi>Moſos</hi> Law, that by Chriſt his comming and death all ceremonies of figure and ſignification are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated and taken away in regard of the vſe of them.<note place="margin">All ſignificant and ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by Chriſt his death in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the vſe of them.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay ceremonies of figure and ſignification for ſome were of order, and may be vſed without binding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the neceſſary vſe of them.

                  <p>The next thing offered vnto vs from this verſe is this, that the Apoſtle in deſcribing the legall ceremonies, vſeth this compariſon, that they are but ſhadowes: Hence we are plainely taught thus much.</p>
                  <p>That the ſignificant ceremonies of the Law were onely <label type="milestone">

Chriſt was onely ſhadowed out by them in the time of the old Teſtament. Chriſt his grace and benefites were not giuen by the very ſacrifices and ceremonies of the Law but they that vſed them were to haue an eye to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them (namely) Chriſt, hence it is that the people of God were often reproued by the Prophets in vſing of thoſe ſacrifices becauſe they reſted in the vſe of them, as if by the verie offerings of a ſacrifice their ſinnes had been taken away, and in their offering they had not an eye to the bodie they looked not at the true perfect ſacifice of Chriſt, whereof thoſe ſacrifice were onely a ſhadowe the Lod therefore ſayth, Iſai. 1.11.12.13. what haue I to doe with the multitude of your ſacrifice, I am full of the burnt offerings of rammes and of the fat of fed beaſts, and I deſire not the bloud of bullockes, nor of lambes, nor of goats.</p>
                  <p>When you come to appeare before me, who required this of your hands to tread in my courts?</p>
                  <p>Bring no more oblations in vaine: incenſe is an abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnto mee: I cannot ſuffer your new moones nor Sabboths nor ſolemne daies (it is iniquitie) nor ſolemne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. What is the reaſon of it? it is giuen ver. 15. in the end for your hands are full of bloud, as if hee had ſayd, when you offer theſe ſacrifices, you reſt in your outward ſeruice, as if the very offering of it were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conferre my grace vppon you, you looke
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:490:353"/> not by faith to the one true perfect ſacrifice, and that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt becauſe you doe not teſtifie your faith by the fruites of it, you ſtill continue in your ſinnes, and ſo your ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are abominable in my ſight, I cannot endure them, Hebr. 10.1. the holy Ghoſt ſayth in plaine termes, that the Law had the ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things.</p>
                  <p>Heer then comes a queſtion to be handled (namely) this.</p>
                  <p>What difference there is betweene the ſacracraments of the old teſtament and our Sacraments of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The Papiſts in anſwer to this queſtion ſay, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the old teſtament did only ſignifie and ſhadow out grace to bee giuen afterward by the paſſion of Chriſt, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Thirdly, our Sacraments doe more plainely and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet Chriſt and his death before vs then did theirs.</p>
                  <p>For as in the new Teſtament, the meanes of reuelation is more cleere, the light of faith greater, and the meaſure of grace more ample, ſo alſo by the ſacraments of the newe Teſtament is the grace of Chriſt more plainely and fully and plentifully offered and diſperſed then by the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Now this wee are to conſider. Is it ſo that the grace of Chriſt, is not nowe ſet before vs in obſcure ſhadowes, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Well, let vs remember what our Sauiour ſayth in that place, this is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men loue darkeneſſe rather then light, ſo certainely wee may iuſtly feare, that this will bee to our deeper condemnation, that the truth and ſubſtance of the old ſhadowes is come into the world, and yet wee rather loue the ſhadows of pleaſure and worldly profits then this enduring ſubſtance, therefore our iudgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation ſhall be the greater.</p>

                  <p>And in both theſe are couched &amp; contained arguments of refutation to repell that falſe doctrine of the worſhip of Angels.</p>
                  <p>The diſſwaſion is in theſe words (let no man at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the particular thing whereby falſe teachers would beare rule ouer them, and defraude them, and that was the worſhip of Angels; which is amplified by the meanes vſed to perſwade thereunto (namely) <hi>humbleneſſe of minde</hi> (by humbleneſſe of minde) for ſo (as I take it) thoſe two things are to be conceiued and diſtinguiſhed in the purpoſe of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>That the one was the thing whereby falſe teachers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to beare rule ouer the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>

                  <p>And the other, the meanes vſed to perſwade them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                  <p>The deſcription of falſe teachers, what they were, is in the words following.</p>

                     <hi>(Aduancing himſelfe in thoſe things which hee neuer ſaw.)</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the arguments included in this diſſwaſion and deſcription to refell the falſe doctrine of the worſhippe of Angels, are eſpecially theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that ſuch worſhip is moſt dangerous, if they ſhould embrace it, it would bee a meanes to drawe them from Chriſt, to defraude them of their price, and to bring them into thrall and bondage to the corrupt wils of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that ſuch worſhip is not built on any good
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:490:355"/> ground, but thruſt out from the vaine ſpeculation of men taking on them the knowledge of things they neuer ſaw, and that through the vaine pride of their owne fleſhly mindes.</p>
                  <p>Come we to the words of this verſe, and firſt,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of the diſſwaſion <hi>(Let no man at his pleaſure beare rule ouer you, by humbleneſſe of minde, and worſhipping of Angels)</hi> Wee finde but one word in the originall, heere tranſlated (beare rule ouer you) and for the vnderſtanding of it, we muſt know that the heathens in their games and publike exerciſes of wreſtling, and the like; had ſome that vſed to ſit as vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires to giue to them that did beſt the rewarde of a garland, a crowne, or ſome ſuch thing. Now the word heere vſed is <hi>Metaphoricall,</hi> and it is taken from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vniuſt dealing of ſuch vmpires, who no doubt ſometimes defrauded them of the priſe, that deſerued it. From ſuch vniuſt dealing of ſuch vmpires is the word heere borrowed, and it ſignifieth after the manner of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt vmpires to defraude men of the priſe that is due to them: the meaning is to draw them from Chriſt, and ſo to defraude them of eternall life and ſaluation, due vnto them, in, and thorow him (at his pleaſure) that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne luſt, without any reaſon at all (by humbleneſſe of minde) the meaning of it is not, by true humbleneſſe of minde, for that is an exellent grace and vertue: but by a counterfet ſhew of it, vnder a colour of humbleneſſe of minde (and worſhipping of Angels) the words are (religion of angels) and the meaning is, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious adoration, or inuocation of Angels, thus then wee are to conceiue the meaning of this diſwaſion.</p>
                  <q>Let no man according to the luſt of his owne heart without any ground at all by his falſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions draw you from Chriſt, and defraude you of the priſe of eternall life due to you in him: and that by perſwading you vnder a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of humbleneſſe of minde to the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:490:356"/> and worſhip of Angels.</q>
                  <p>Now firſt, obſerue we heere that the Apoſtle was not content with his former diſſwaſion, Verſe 16. Let no man therefore condemne you in meat and drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the Sabbath daies. But he ſubioines this to it as needfull alſo, Let no man at his pleaſure beare rule ouer you by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of minde, and worſhipping of Angels. Thereby giuing vs to vnderſtand, that falſe teachers vſed not one kinde of impoſture to draw the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> from the truth, but on while they vrged circumſion, and the obſeruation of the legall Ceremonies to be needfull to ſaluation: an other while they magnified angels, and vnder a colour of humbleneſſe of minde, ſought to bring in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Angels. Hence we may eaſily take vp this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

We ſhall be able to diſcerne betweene truth and errour, and ſpy out the ſubtiltie of Satan going about to deceiue vs.</p>
                  <p>The next thing we are to obſerue in this diſwaſion is, that the Apoſtle ſaith not, Let no man ſeduce you by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule ouer you by humbleneſſe of minde, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Angels, but he ſets out ſuch ſeducement with the danger of it, that it is like to proue a defrauding of them of the priſe of eternall life, let no man defraude you of the priſe of eternall life and ſaluation due vnto him, in, and through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence are we taught how dangerous a thing it is to bee <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> ſeduced and drawne away to any fundamentall error,<note place="margin">It is a very dangerous thing to bee drawne away to any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall error. The doctrine explaned.</note> ſuch as is the inuocation and worſhip of Angels: men that are ſo ſeduſed are in danger thereby to loſe eternall life; and that this doctrine be not miſtaken, I muſt of neceſſitie a little futther explane it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, I ſay it is dangerous to be drawne away to ſuch an errour as is againſt the foundation, and doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturne any truth neceſſary to be beleeued to ſaluation, as the vnity of the Godhead, the trinity of perſons, that Ieſus Chriſt is the onely Sauiour of all Gods choſen, that we are redeemed by him, that we are iuſtified in the ſight of God by faith, without workes, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay not, that ſuch an one as is ſeduced and drawne away, ſhall neuer come to life and ſaluation,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:490:357"/> but that he is in danger to loſe eternall life, for happily he may be drawne and fall into that errour of weakeneſſe and ignorance, it was the caſe of the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 1.6. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that ye are ſo ſoone remoued away vnto an other Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, from him that had called you in the grace of Chriſt, and he may continue in it ignorantly for a time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward repent and be ſaued. Thus then conceiue we the doctrine, that he that is drawne away to any errour, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the truth neceſſary to be knowne and beleeued to ſaluation, is in great danger to loſe eternall life, and to be damned foreuer, for he may come to hold that errour obſtinately to the end, and then hee ſhuts himſelfe out from all poſſibilitie of ſaluation. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. Yee are aboliſhed from Chriſt, whoſoeuer are iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law, yee are fallen from grace. The meaning is, you that are of that erronious opinion, and hold it ſtifly, that you are iuſtified by the Law, you are aboliſhed from Chriſt, Chriſt is to you an empty and vnprofitable Chriſt, and then as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12.

                  <p>Marke we further, the Apoſtle ſaith, Let no man beare <label type="milestone">

Hauing handled that point, I will not now ſtand vpon it, nor now remember the vſe was made of it: but conſider wee the truth of this in an other kinde: as falſe teachers leade the ſimple into error, and hold them in it at their pleaſure; euen thus doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked inſtruments of ſinne, ſuch as are meanes to
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:490:358"/> draw others to ſinne, and to leade them to luſt and lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to riot and vnthrifty meanes, doe not they leade them at their pleaſure and hold them in ſinne, as they liſt.

                  <p>The Papiſts ſay, Chriſt indeede is the onely Mediatour of redemption, but Angels an Saints are Mediators of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, which diſtinction is flat againſt the plaine eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>We are taught, Heb. 7.24. that Chrlſt hrs Prieſthood is euerlaſting, and one part of honor belonging to his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is to make interceſſion as followeth, ver. 25. &amp; Ro. 8. the Apoſtle ſayth in plaine wordes, that Chriſt ſitteth at

                  <p>Come we to the deſcription of falſe teachers, what they were.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, they are deſcribed by their boldneſſe, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they durſt boldly take on them the knowledge of things which they had neuer ſeene expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing himſelfe in thoſe things which he neuer ſaw.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, I will firſt cleare the words; the word tranſlated <hi>(aduancing)</hi> doth properly ſignifie boldly,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> ſetting his foot vpon an other mans poſſeſſion, without al right and title, thruſting himſelfe into the poſſeſſion of that belongs not vnto him, the meaning is after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of an intruder thruſting himſelfe into the knowledge, or taking on him the knowledge and determination (in thoſe things which hee neuer ſaw) (that is) thoſe things he neuer ſaw with the eie of his body, nor yet by the eie of faith, for faith is of things not ſeene by the eie of the body <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. our Sauiour ſaith to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Ioh. 20.29.

                  <p>Thus then we are to conceiue theſe words, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaid.</p>
                  <p>As an intruder boldly thruſting himſelfe into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and taking on him the knowledge of things hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaw, either by the eie of his bodie, or by the eie of faith, made known in the written word of God, euen of things whereof he hath no teſtimonie, either from experience, or

                  <p>I might heere ſtand to ſhew, that the worſhip of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is a thing meerely deuiſed, and a thing inuented and thruſt out from the vaine wit of ſome men who tooke on them to know things concerning the Angels, for which they had no warrant, either from experience, or from the the word of God, but I hold it not needfull to ſtand on that point, I will rather ſpeake of the generall concluſion offered from this part of the deſcription of falſe teachers, that they were ſuch as did aduance themſelues in things they neuer ſaw.</p>

                  <p>And that wee may rightly conceiue that the relation and vnion that is betweene Chriſt and his Church, com-Church pared to a head and a body.</p>
                  <p>Know we firſt that there beeing two natures in Chriſt, his diuine and humane, Chriſt is the head to his Church, in reſpect of both,<note place="margin">Chhriſt is head to his Church in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of both his natures.</note> euen whole Chriſt God and man; for he is ſo the head, as he is the Sauiour of his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe two are conioined by the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 5.23. Chriſt is the head of his Church and the ſame is the Sauiour of his body. Now Chriſt is the Sauiour of his Church, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his diuine nature alone, nor according to his humane nature alone, but whole Chriſt in his Godhead, and in his ſoule and fleſh; Therefore whole Chriſt is the head of his Church, and the Church and euery true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is vnited to whole Chriſt, yet in this order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to the fleſh and manhood of Chriſt, and then by that to the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee are to knowe that though the vnion whereby Chriſt and his Church are conioined be a true and reall vnion; yet is it not naturall, as when two things are ioined in one nature, nor perſonall, as the ſoule and body are vnited; nor politicall or ciuill, as the Prince and people are conioined: but it is myſticall and ſpirituall by the bond of the ſame ſpirit,<note place="margin">The vnion of Chriſt and his Church is myſticall.</note> and by faith.

                  <p>And firſt of all, this may ſerue to confirme that truth of Doctrine deliuered in our Church.</p>

                  <p>To this I anſwer: <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Againe, conſent is not ſimply an infallible note of the Church, for it is ſometime amongſt the wicked, as among <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, and among the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſſe, Luk 11.21.

That the Lord added to the Church from day to day ſuch as ſhould bee ſaued, but that is not heere meant, the meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe words, is briefly this.</p>
                  <q>That the whole Church, and euery member of the myſticall body of Chriſt, receiues increaſe from Chriſt the head, in regard of ſpirituall grace, as of faith, hope, loue, patience, &amp;c. which hee calles the increaſe of God, becauſe it is diuine and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</q>

                  <p>This verſe hath relation to that which is immediately foregoing, on this manner; in the verſe before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhewes that there is that neere vnion betweene Chriſt and his Church, that there is betweene the head and the body; and what Chriſt did as mediator the members of his Church did it with him: when hee died, they died with him: hereupon the Apoſtle doth inferre in this verſe, <hi>Wherefore if yee be dead with Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> In this verſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle beginnes to deale againſt the corruption of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and againſt ſeducement and drawing away the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> from the truth, by meanes of certaine humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and traditions, that falſe teachers ſought to thruſt vpon them, as things neceſſary to be obſerued for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſcience ſake, and needfull to ſaluation: and in this verſe is laid downe his firſt argument of confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An argument confuting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane decrees and traditions</note>The argument is this.</p>
                  <q>Yee are freed by Chriſt from the rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law, therefore you ought not to be ſubiect to mens decrees and traditions that ſeeme to be deriued from thence.</q>
                  <p>Some would haue the argument in this place to be from the greater to the leſſe. Thus
<q>Yee are not now ſubiect to the rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law being freed from them by Chriſt, therefore much leſſe ought you to bee ſubiect to rites and ceremonies that are inuented by the braine of men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as I take it, the argument is not ſo, but as now I haue laid it downe. For it is not like that the falſe teachers
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:490:380"/> of thoſe times ſought to impoſe on the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things then ſuch as were either taken from Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and the learning of the Gentiles, or from the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſuch were their traditions here ſpoken of, it may appeare by the expreſſing of them in theſe termes, touch not, taſte not, handle not: which no doubt were imitations of legall rites and ceremonies; and ſo the argument of the Apoſtle in this verſe is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as I haue propounded it.</p>
                  <p>More ſpecially wee haue laid before vs in this Verſe; Firſt, the Apoſtles reaſon to diſwade the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> from ſubmitting to the decrees and traditions of men (namely) this, that they were freed from them by Chriſt his death, laid downe in the proofe of it, that with Chriſt they were dead, and by death freed from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the inference on that reaſon, therefore you ought not to ſubiect your ſelues to them; deliuered by way of interrogation, why are yee burdened with them? amplified by exprobration of the abſurdity of ſuch ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that it is all one as if they ſtill liued in the world. <hi>(Why, as though yee liued in the world, are yee burdened with traditions?)</hi>

                  <p>

Now, whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Dead from the ordinances of the world,</hi> it is not an vſuall manner of ſpeaking in the Scripture, to ſay, <hi>Dead from,</hi> but rather, <hi>dead to this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> as dead to the Law, dead to ſinne; and therefore the meaning is, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaid; Dead, and by death freed from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the world, <hi>(as though he liued in the world.)</hi> To liue in the world may betaken two waies.</p>

                  <p>And in this latter ſenſe we are to take theſe words (as though he liued in the world) (that is) as though ye were not dead with Chriſt, and by death freed from the orders of the world, but ſtill liued after the courſe of the worlde <hi>(are yee burdened with traditions)</hi> In the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, wee haue but one word, it cannot bee ſo expreſſed in Engliſh, it ſignifieth thus much; Are ye held vnder the decrees of men, or ſuch things as ſeeme good to men: ſo this tranſlation <hi>(are yee burdened with traditions)</hi> may bee iuſtified, though the Papiſts carpe at it. This then is the meaning of the Apoſtle, in this verſe.</p>
                  <q>If yee as members of Chriſt be dead with him and be as free as dead men from the Ceremonies of the Law, why? as though yee ſtill liued after the courſe of the world, are yee held vnder the decrees and traditions of men, which ſeeme to be deriued from the braine of men.</q>
                  <p>Of the firſt part of this verſe (namely the reaſon of the Apoſtle, If yee be dead with Chriſt from the ordinances of the world; much might bee ſpoken, but wee haue handled the chiefe things thence offered heeretofore, as that there is ſo neere a vnion betweene Chriſt and his members, that when he died, they died with him, of that we ſpake verſe 12. And alſo of the doctrine offered from thoſe words, ordinances or rudiments of the world, wee ſpake verſe 8. I will not now againe handle thoſe points onely. One thing more we may gather from the reaſon of the Apoſtle. And for concluding the point, we are to mark, that the Apoſtle ſaith, If ye be dead with Chriſt from the ordinances of the world, meaning, if yee bee freed from them, he puts dead from them, for freed from them; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying indeed, that they were as free from them as dead
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:490:381"/> men that had nothing to doe with them. The point that hence I gather is this.</p>
                  <p>That death is a freedom, death ſets men at liberty from <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> the lawes and ordinances of men, yea from all hard tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, from bondage and ſeruitude in the world,<note place="margin">Death ſets men free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lawes of men and from all hard taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world.</note> and from all miſeries they are ſubiect to in this world, that which <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith of the ſeruant <hi>Iob</hi> 3.19. That death ſets him free from his maſter, is true of all kind of outward ſeruitude, bondage, ſlauerie, or miſerie that men vndergoe in this life whatſoeuer, death frees them from it; the afflictions are but for this life onely, Rom. 8.18. Death puts an ende to them; the malice of the Deuill, the rage of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and violence of bloudie perſecutors can reach no further then this life: they can but kill the body, as our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. and when that is done they muſt ceaſe from their tyranny, therefore we are not to feare them. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Our Sauiour himſelfe makes this vſe of it, feare not them which kill the body, and when they haue done that can go no further, but feare him which is able to deſtroy both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule in hell.<note place="margin">Wee are not to feare them only who can kill the body but him who can deſtroy both body and ſoule.</note>

                  <p>In this Verſe our Apoſtle brings two other arguments to diſſwade the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> from ſuffering themſelues to be held vnder the decrees of men, of not touching, taſting, or handling this or that kinde of meate.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, is from the condition of things, about which their decrees were in theſe words, <hi>(which all periſh with the vſing)</hi> it may thus bee conceiued, ſuch decrees as are of tranſitory things, the obſeruation whereof hath no force nor ſtrength to ſaluation and to life euerlaſting, you are not to place holineſſe and religion in them, but ſuch are theſe decrees (touch not, taſte not, handle not) and that is laid downe in the proofe of it, theſe are of things vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and paſſing away with the vſing of them, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no longer, therefore you are not to place holineſſe and religion in them.</p>
                  <pb n="750" facs="tcp:490:388"/>
                  <p>The ſecond argument is from the efficient cauſe of ſuch decrees of men, that they were the commandements of men, and therefore they ſhould not ſuffer themſelues to be held vnder them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Of theſe in order. <hi>(Which all periſh with the vſing)</hi> (that is) all which touching, taſting, and handling, together with the things to be touched, taſted, and handled, <hi>(periſh with the vſing)</hi> the words ſignifie (are to corruption in the vſe) the meaning is, are conſumed in the vſe, or are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and endure no longer then the very vſe of them and both they and the vſe of them doe vaniſh and paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the time.</p>
                  <p>Now, heere firſt the argument of the Apoſtle is to bee conſidered, in that he reaſoneth thus; that the decrees of falſe teachers were of things periſhing, and paſſing away with the vſe of them, and therefore the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ought not to place holineſſe in them. Hence we are giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thus much.</p>

Cor. 8 8. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith plainely, meate maketh not vs acceptable to God; for, neither if we eate, haue we the more, neither if we eate not haue we the leſſe. The meaning is, more or leſſe piety and religion, or are more or leſſe pleaſing to God, Rom. 14.17. The Apoſtle ſaith, the kingdome of God is not meate nor drinke (that is) religion and the power of it, ſtandeth not in meate and drinke, but in
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:490:388"/> righteouſneſſe, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is this, becauſe godlineſſe and religion as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Tim. 4.8. is profitable, it is of vſe to all things hauing the promiſe, both of this life, and of that which is to come.</p>

But for the point in hand, I hope it is cleare, that Religion and the worſhip of God conſiſteth not in things vaniſhing and paſſing away with the time.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, this meets with that error of the Papiſts, who place a principall part of Gods worſhip in the vſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <label type="milestone">

                  <p>We are in the firſt place to conſider the argument it ſelfe in that the Apoſtle reaſoneth thus, that the Coloſſians ſhould not be held vnder thoſe decrees of falſe teachers, of not touching, not taſting, not handling, as things of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary obſervation vnto their ſaluation, becauſe they were precepts and commandements of men, hauing no ground in the word of God; we are plainely taught thus much.</p>
                  <p>That men can giue no precepts nor rules without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the worde of God of neceſſarie obſeruation to life euerlaſting: rules giuen by men not grounded on Gods worde in caſe of religion, in matters of faith and manners are not of any moment, or of any neceſſity, we are not neceſſarily bound to the obſeruation of them

                  <p>The firſt, is an exhortation to all Chriſtians, generally as they are Chriſtians and profeſſors of the Goſpell from the 1. verſe to the 18.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part is a comprehenſion of certain ſpeciall duties of Chriſtians, as they haue relation one to another in ſome particular ſtate and condition of life, as of the dutie of wiues towards their husbands, children towards their parents, ſeruants towards their maſters; the Apoſtle exhorting thereunto from the 18. verſe of this Chapter to the ſecond verſe of the 4. Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The generall exhortation ſubdiuided.</note>Now the generall exhortation may bee againe ſubdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: it containes in it an exhortation to ſeeke, and to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heauenly things, from the firſt verſe to the fift, and then an exhortation to Chriſtian duties of the morall Law, to duties required of Chriſtians in the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and firſt to the duties of the ſecond Table, from the 5. verſe to the 16. and then to duties of the firſt Table in the 16. and 17. verſes.</p>
                  <p>Now then the foure firſt verſes of this Chapter contain an exhortation to ſeeke, and to effect things aboue, and not things on the earth, and that exhortation is expounded and vrged in the 1. &amp; 2. verſes, and then in the 3. &amp; 4. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is that remooued which might diſcourage from that ſeeking and affecting of things aboue.</p>
                  <p>In this firſt verſe, more ſpecially we haue the Apoſtles exhortation to ſeeke things that are aboue, which is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by the place where they are (namely) where Chriſt is in heauen, together with the glorious ſtate of Chriſt there, that hee ſits at the right hand of God. Seeke thoſe
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:490:402"/> things which are aboue <hi>(where Chriſt ſits &amp;c.)</hi> And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is vrged by an argument taken from the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of that ſeeking (namely) fellowſhip with Chriſt in his reſurrection, and it may be thus framed: <hi>If you be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with Chriſt, then ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue,</hi> but you are riſen with Chriſt, that is grounded on the 12. &amp; 13. verſes of the Chapter before, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>as many as beleeued, were buried with Chriſt, and raiſed vp with him:</hi> and ſo he brings in this argument as a conſequent on that, if then, or, if therefore yee be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue: So then the ſumme and ſubſtance of this verſe is this, an exhortation to the Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſeeke things aboue, where Chriſt is in glory at the right hand of God, vrged from their fellowſhip with Chriſt in his reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Come we to the words of it as they are laid downe by the Apoſtle, and firſt of theſe words: <hi>(If yee then bee riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue.)</hi> If then, or if therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) with relation to that which went before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.12.13.<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>(bee riſen with Chriſt)</hi> to bee riſen with Chriſt, is to haue fellowſhip with Chriſt in his reſurrection, beeing one with him by the bond of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by faith to be partakers both of the benefit of his reſurrection, (namely) of a full abſolution from ſinne and iuſtification, and of the vertue and power of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our viuification, to a raiſing of vs vp, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of vs to newneſſe of life in this life, and to the raiſing vp of our bodies to life euerlaſting, at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>(Seeke)</hi> this word <hi>(ſeeke)</hi> is Metaphoricall, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and taken from thoſe that ſeeke, and ſearch for ſomethings which they would gladly find; and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle is, beſtow all kind of endeauour, and labour, vſe all good meanes to attaine all thoſe things which are aboue <hi>(by things aboue)</hi> the Apoſtle meanes, things in heauen, and yet not things in heauen ſecret, and hid from vs which are not able to conceiue and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,

                  <p>And there be two reaſons why affections are not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but onely ordered. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The firſt is this, God himſelfe planted them in the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of man in the firſt creation, they beeing nothing elſe but particular motions of his will, and therefore they are not to be taken away by religion; for religion is not to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh any power or motion of the minde or will, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remooue the corruption of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, affections renued containe in them a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> part of holineſſe and of the image of God, and being orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Now deſire is not to be rooted out, but to be ordered by grace, and turned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and ſet on heauen, and heauenly things; and thus we are to deale with the motions of our hearts, wee are to labour to haue them ſanctified, and rightly ordered, and know we that according to our affections, ſo ſhall wee profit both by the workes and word of God: many ſee the wonderfull workes of God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and heare his word, with others, and yet profit not as others doe, becauſe the Lord hath not giuen them the like good affections; when therefore thou ſeeſt the iudgements of God, on any place, or perſon, or heareſt his word, pray that the Lord would fill thine heart with holy affections and the Lord ſo doing

                  <p>The firſt wordes of this verſe, containe an argument to confirme the Apoſtles dehortation, in the laſt wordes of the ſecond verſe, (namely) from minding and affecting things on the earth, and the argument is from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Coloſſians beleeuing in Chriſt <hi>(that they were dead)</hi> and it may thus bee framed, dead men haue no minde, nor further care for the things of this life, but yee are deade, therefore you ought not to minde them.</p>
                  <p>Now to this argument, happily the Coloſſians might take exception, they might reply and ſay, are wee dead? why then wee are not to minde and affect things aboue, dead men minde nothing, the Apoſtle therefore preuents
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:490:415"/> this obiection, in the next words by further explication of his ſpeech, letting them vnderſtand that howſoeuer they were dead, yet not ſimply dead, but ſo as they had life, and hee ſets downe what manner of life they had (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>a life hid, yet are dead, and your life is hid</hi>) yet heereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on peraduenture the corrupt nature of man might further inferre, and ſay, is our life hid doth it not appeare, why then ſhould we ſeeke and affect things that pertaine to that life that appeares not, and omit the things of this life? this alſo the Apoſtle doth meet withall, and to this hee anſwers in the words following, ſetting before them how this life was hid (namely <hi>with Chriſt.</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                  <p>Let vs now ſearch out the meaning of the wordes of this verſe <hi>(for yee are dead)</hi> that is with Chriſt, as wee haue it in the chapter before, verſe the twentieth, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with Chriſt by faith are dead with him, that is,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as partakers of the power of his death, and are as dead men in regarde of ſinne, and of worldly happineſſe ſtanding in worldly pleaſures, profits and honours, and ſuch like, <hi>and your life</hi>) that is, your happy life begunne in this world, to bee made perfect in the life to come, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſſe, and glory, that once yee ſhall haue both in your bodies and ſoules; and that I gather to be the

                  <p>For ye beleeuing in Chriſt, are partakers of the power of his death, and are as dead men in regard of ſinne, and of worldly happineſſe and your happy life, your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holineſſe, and glory, that once you ſhall haue both in your bodies and ſoules, is altogether hid from the eyes of the world and in great meaſure from your ſelues, euen as Chriſt now ſitting at the right hand of his father, is hidde from the eies of men on the earth, and is layd vp in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and powerfull hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Now here firſt we are to obſerue, that as from hauing part with Chriſt in his reſurrection, our Apoſtle in the firſt ver.

                  <p>The firſt is to the mortification of ſuch ſinnes as were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> neere, and deare to themſelues, and did properly belong to their owne pleaſures and profits, and that is laid down, and vrged by certaine reaſons in the 5.6.7. verſes.</p>

                  <p>Now this inference is on this manner, the Apoſtle verſe 4. laid before the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that at the appearance of Chriſt to iudgement, they beleeuing in Chriſt ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly appeare with him in glory. Heereupon euen on this promiſe of glory, he doth inferre this exhortation. <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie therefore your members, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid you haue the promiſe of glory, and you certainely looke to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with Chriſt at his appearance, therefore you ought to labour, that (if it bee poſſible) you may bee found of him without ſpot of ſinne, and to that end, you are to mortifie the body of ſinne, and all the members of it; that is the dependance of this verſe with that which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe conſidered by it ſelfe, wee haue laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>(Mortifie)</hi> is Metaphoricall,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> it is borrowed from <hi>Chirurgions</hi> who when they muſt of neceſſitie cut off ſome part of a mans body (as in ſome diſeaſes they muſt, then they vſe to lay plaſters to that part that is ill infected, and to bee cut off, to mortifie it, that is, to make it dead without ſenſe and feeling, that it may be cut off with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paine to the party as may be, from this manner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the word heere borrowed and taken, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle in ſaying, <hi>(Mortifie)</hi> is this, doe as <hi>Chirurgians</hi> doe in ſome caſes, vſe all good meanes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, to take away life from our earthly members to kill them, and to make them no more able to ſtirre then mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers mortified; yea, no more then a dead karcaſſe, for ſo doth the originall word ſignifie. <hi>(Your members)</hi> that is, your ſinnefull motions, luſts, and affections, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature is compared to a body, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.11. and the motions, luſts, and affections, that ariſe from them, are as members of that monſtrous body, and therefore are called members by the Apoſtle; and againe, they are ſaid to be as members, becauſe being not mortified they haue force in all the members of the body to bring foorth ſinne, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>The motions of ſinne haue force in our members to bring foorth fruit vnto death.</hi> Yea, thoſe motions and luſts that iſſue out from naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, beeing not mortified, they runne through the whole body, and ſoule, and doe fill all the powers of the ſoule, and al the parts of the body with ſin, and therefore they are called members <hi>(which are one the earth)</hi> that is earthly, which tend onely to-earthly pleaſures, and ſhall
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:490:432"/> neuer be admitted into the kingdome of heauen as it is, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.27.</p>
                  <p>Thus then, vnderſtand we this exhortation, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaid, doe you as <hi>Chyrurgians</hi> vſe to doe, when they are of neceſſitie to cut off ſome member of a mans body, vſe you all good meanes to benumme, yea, to kill, and to make dead your ſinnefull motions, luſts, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are as members of that body of natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in you, and being not mortified haue force in all the powers of our ſoules, and in all the members of our bodies to bring foorth ſinne, and tend onely to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pleaſures and profits, and ſhall neuer be admitted into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>Now heere, firſt obſerue we the inference, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this verſe on the former, our Apoſtle hauing laid downe the certaine hope of glorie with Chriſt, that no ſooner ſhall Chriſt appeare, but all that beleeue in him ſhall appeare with him in glory; we are to marke that hee preſentlie ſubioines to this, the dutie of mortification, and ſaith, <hi>(Mortifie therefore your members, &amp;c.)</hi>

                     </note>Come wee then to conſider ſuch meanes, for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of this foule ſinne, the luſt of couetouſneſſe. The ſpeciall meanes that ſerue to that purpoſe, are chieflie three.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a due conſideration of the inſufficiency of riches in themſelues, and of themſelues to doe vs any good; for (as we haue heard) it is an imagination of ſome good, or happineſſe to be found in riches, that ſets the hart a worke to deſire them exceſſiuely.

                  <p>The ſecond means to this purpoſe is this: we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that abundance of wealth giuen to vs vpon our gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and vnſatiable deſire of it, is not only inſufficient to do vs good, but hath the curſe of God attending on it, for we ſinned in ſo deſiring it, and our ſinnefull deſire being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that abundance is giuen vnto vs in Gods wrath,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and not in his mercy, why then ſhould we enlarge our hearts immoderately to deſire wealth, which beeing giuen vpon that deſire, hath the curſe of God attending on it.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>I will open and vnfolde the ſence and meaning of the wordes, <hi>(wherein)</hi> ſome render the wordes thus,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> 
                     <hi>(among whom)</hi> with relation to the laſt words of the verſe forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (the children of diſobedience) but indeed it is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the context, and to the argument, and purpoſe of the Apoſtle, to retaine this tranſlation <hi>(wherin)</hi> with a reference to the ſinnes before ſpoken of, and ſo the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is in which ſinne <hi>(ye alſo)</hi> that is, you Coloſſians now called as well as others <hi>(walked)</hi> this word is metaphoricall borrowed from paſſengers, or rather from ſuch as walke in ſome place for pleaſure and recreation, and ſo the Apoſtles meaning is, that they held on a courſe ſecurely, and with delight in thoſe ſinnes <hi>(once)</hi> that is, ſometimes heeretofore <hi>(when ye liued in them)</hi> heerein the Apoſtle hath reſpect to that which he hath often ſayd before, that they were dead with Chriſt, and ſo his meaning in ſaying (when yee liued in them) is, when your naturall corruption as a kinde of life, gaue power and moouing for the exerciſe and practiſe of thoſe ſinnes, thus then briefely conceiue wee the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="878" facs="tcp:490:457"/> of the Apoſtle, in the words of this verſe, as if hee had ſayd.</p>
                  <p>In which ſinnes before named, you beleeuing Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as well a others, held on your courſe ſecurely heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, euen when your naturall corruption was a liue in you, and gaue power, and moouing for the exerciſe and practiſe of thoſe ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing heere to be marked is, that the Apoſtle ſayth, that the Coloſſians alſo walked in the ſinnes before named, ſignifying, that not onely the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but euen they alſo as well as others before their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and conuerſion walked in thoſe ſinnes? hence then we are taught.</p>

                  <p>The anſwer is eaſie, theſe two things rightly conceiued may well ſtand together, there is no oppoſition betweene them, as there ſeemes to bee, for naturall men are ſayd to be dead in ſinne in reſpect of goodneſſe, becauſe they are ſo held vnder the power of ſinne, as a dead man is vnder death, and haue no power at all to mooue towardes anie thing that is good. But they are ſaid to walke in ſinne, in reſpect of ſinne, it ſelfe, and therein they haue liuely-hood and actiuitie, therein they haue not only a power to moue but doe actually mooue, ſtirre and exerciſe all the powers of their ſoules, and members of their bodies, wee are therefore to holde it for a trueth, that it is proper to men in their naturall condition to walke in ſinne, to holde on a ſecure courſe in ſinne with pleaſure, ſuch as are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate they fall ſometimes into ſinne, but it is one thing to fall into ſinne, and another to walke in it, as it is one

                  <p>Come we therefore to the vſe of it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, this doctrine meetes with that errour of the <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>(But now)</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle (as wee haue heard) hath reſpect to that which went before, and his meaning is this, but now being conuerted, truely called, and wrought on by the ſpirit of God: <hi>(put away)</hi> The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall word vſed by the Apoſtle hath many ſignifications, it ſignifieth ſometimes to lay vp, ſomething to be vſed in times following, after the manner of Apothecaries, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a time to ſuſpend, ſometimes to abdicate, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, ſometimes to put off, as we doe our apparell, and ſo it is tranſlated, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. ſometimes to caſt away, ſo rendred, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. and many other ſignifications there be of this word, but one ſignification it hath, that doth moſt fitly agree to this place, and to the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, and that is, to put aſide, or to put cleane out of ſight, as we vſe to doe the bodies of dead men, when wee burie them, and put them into their graues, to this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth heere allude, when he ſaith <hi>(put away)</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in his ſimilitude begun verſe 5. Mortifie your ſins, kill them, and then he goes on, and ſaith, put them aſide, cleane out of ſight, as dead bodies are when they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and ſo his meaning is, deale with your ſinnes, as you vſe to deale with the dead bodies of men, burie them, put them cleane out of your ſight, haue no more to doe with them, then the liuing vſe to haue with the dead: <hi>(yee alſo)</hi> for ſo runnes the text in the originall <hi>(But now put away, yee alſo)</hi> that is, yee aſwell as other true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers

                  <p>
                     <hi>(But now put away. &amp;c.)</hi> as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But now being conuerted and truely called, put away cleane out of ſight, and deale you with all theſe ſinnes, as other true beleeuers doe, bury them, haue no more to do with them, then the liuing haue with the dead, let them be taken quite out of the way, let not any print, or memory of them remaine amongſt you.</p>
                  <p>Now heere, firſt, we are to marke, that the Apoſtle vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his exhortation by the circumſtance of time, and of the condition of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> now conuerted, and now truly beleeuing, that whereas before when they were in their naturall condition, they walked in ſinne, now being conuerted, and beleeuing in Chriſt, they ought to mortifie, and to put away the ſinnes, wherein before they walked; wee ſee then, the Apoſtle makes effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a ground whereon to build his exhortation, hee held the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> truelie conuerted, and effectuallie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and heereupon hee doth exhort them to put away <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Hence we may gather a maine difference between ſuch as are in their natuall condition, and ſuch as are taken out of it, effectually called, and truelie regenerate; the one ſort walke on in ſinne, and can doe nothing but hold on a continued courſe in ſinne, but the other, they are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſtirre, and to moue themſelues to do that which is truely good, and to mortifie, and to put away their owne ſinnes; howſoeur, indeed, in the firſt act of conuerſion, and regeneration men are meerelie paſſiue not able to moue, or to doe any thing tending thereunto; yet in the courſe of holineſſe, after true conuerſion, they are able to
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:490:462"/> mooue and doe that which is truely good, and to auoide euill; for true faith wrought in the heart by the ſpirit of God, doth alter and change the heart, and doth turne a man into a new creature, and conuerſation, as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>Faith purifieth the heart:</hi> and the heart once purified, the whole man is altered and changed.</p>

                  <p>Firſt we muſt know that <hi>(Anger)</hi> is a naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was planted in our firſt Parents, in the firſt creation, yea, it was found in Chriſt himſelfe who was without ſinne, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. <hi>hee looked round about on them ungodly,</hi> and therefore anger is not in it ſelfe a ſinne, and alwayes ſinnefull.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we muſt know that anger is ſometimes lawfull and good, yea ſometimes not onely allowed, but required as <hi>Eue</hi> ſhould haue beene angry with the ſerpent, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> with her, for tempting to ſinne, and anger is then law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good,<note place="margin">Note</note> when it is rightly conceiued, and directed to a right obiect (namely) againſt ſinne (for as one ſayth well) he that is not angry for ſinne,<note place="margin">When anger is good, and when it is not good.</note> either knowes not ſin (or hates it not as hee ought) anger therefore is lawfull, and good when it is rightly conceiued, and directed to a right obiect, and that with due meaſure; according to the nature of the obiect, and this I might ſhew by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Scripture, as of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Phineas,</hi> of <hi>Elias, Dauid, Nehemiah, &amp;c.</hi> yea, thus our Sauiour ſhewed himſelfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with <hi>Peter,</hi>

                  <list>

                  <p>And theſe three things euer meet together in a lie, and ſo a lie is a voluntary ſpeaking of that a man knowes to be falſe with a minde, and purpoſe to deceiue; yet that wee miſconceiue not this point, know that in ſpeaking ſome things, one word or one thing may bee put for another, and yet no lie,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as it is in Metaphors, and other figuratiue ſpeaches; yea ſometimes a thing ſuppoſed, or fained may be vttered, and yet no lie, as it is in the Parables of holy Scripture, as that <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.8. of the trees conferring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. propounded by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> of a rich man that had many ſheepe, and a poore man that had but one, and diuers others, yea ſometimes a man may ſpeake ſomething not contrary, but beſide, or diuers from the truth, and yet not lie, as when parents would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate to their children the hurt and danger of ſome place, as of a ditch or pit, they vſe to tell them there is a Beare, or a Bulbegger to keepe them from that place, and that is a thing ſpoken not contrary, but diuers from the truth, and it is nothing elſe but an expreſſing of a concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued danger in other termes, in words of terror, and feare, to keepe their children from it, and this may bee done without fault; for a lie is ſpeaking of that is falſe, and contrarie to the truth willingly, and with an intention to deceiue,<note place="margin">The greatnes of this ſinne appeares by 4. things.</note> and this is a ſinne againſt the ninth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and this may eaſilie appeare vnto vs to bee a great ſinne.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, lying cannot be a ſinne of ignorance, but of an higher nature, euen of preſumption, he that lyeth ſinns not vpon meere ignorance (of which nature many other ſinnes are) but againſt his knowledge, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt his conſcience, if his conſcience be not dead, and paſt feeling.</p>

                  <p>And thirdly, lying is a great ſinne, in that it is not onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hurtfull to men ouertaken, and abuſed by it, but it alſo tends to the vtter ouerthrow of all humane ſocietie, for what comfortable, or profitable ſocietie can men haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if truth in ſpeaking be baniſhed from it?

                  <p>And it is further a plaine euidence of the greatneſſe of this ſinne, in that when a man hath told a lie, yet he would not ſeeme to haue tolde it, and why ſo?

                  <p>Againe, in that the Apoſtle cals actuall ſinnes, <hi>(workes of the old man)</hi> occaſion is giuen to ſhew, that actuall ſinne is a worke not proceeding from God as it is euill, but from

                     <pb n="968" facs="tcp:490:502"/> haue nothing though they haue all things; which indeed is moſt true, and of moſt excellent vſe, that they that haue Chriſt, no miſery can make them miſerable, and they finde more comfort in the leaſt morſel of bread God giues them, then they that haue kingdomes at their command, and yet want Chriſt; but as I take it, this point is not ſo naturally gathered from hence, and therefore I only name it, and paſſe by it.</p>
                  <p>Obſerue we further, that the Apoſtle ſaith, Chriſt is all, and in all things (that is) as wee expounded it to all true beleeuers, he is all-ſufficient to all true beleeuers, whether they be Graecians, or Iewes, &amp;c. of what nation or outward eſtate ſoeuer they be.</p>
                  <p>Heereby, firſt we may ſee, how that text is much abuſed by ſome, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That God will all men ſhall be ſaued.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note</note> Is to be vnderſtood not of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons on the earth, but of all ſorts and kindes of men; for the Apoſtle heere ſaith, that Chriſt is all to all, meaning all beleeuing Graecians, Iewes, &amp;c. to men of all Nations, and conditions, and ſo hee teacheth how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that other place, <hi>That God would all men to be ſaued.</hi> Yea, heereby we may ſee that the Church of Chriſt is Catholike, it is vniuerſall ſpread ouer all the world, it is not to bee drawne from the fellowſhip of all nations, to one citie of Rome, or a peece of Europe, as it is by the Papiſts, or as once it was by the Donatiſts, to a part of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrica. But on theſe things I will not ſtand, the point more profitable hence offered is this.</p>
                  <p>In that the Apoſtle ſaith, Chriſt is all to all, euen to all beleeuers renewed according to Gods Image whatſoeuer they be.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may gather thus much.</p>

                  <p>Againe, conſider that forgiueneſſe one of another is an vndoubted and infallible argument to perſwade our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="0"/> that we likewiſe haue our ſinnes remitted and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, and without that wee not onely haue no ſuch aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but on the contrary haue iuſt cauſe to feare, that the Lord will purſue vs to the vtmoſt for our ſinnes, according to that fearefull parable Matth. 18.24. to the end of the chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now then lay theſe two things together.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, that Chriſt Ieſus hee ſuffered and bare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wrath of his father, euen all that was due to all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of Gods choſen, it coſt him the ſhedding of his deareſt bloud to procure remiſſion of our ſinnes.</p>

                  <p>Come we to the amplification of this duty, of forgiuing one

                  <p>Heere then obſerue wee, that that the Apoſtle doeth limit forgiueneſſe one of another to matter of quarrell, hee boundes our forgiueneſſe one of another, vppon iuſt cauſe of complaint, on matter of offence, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, offered or done to vs by our brethren, this is to bee marked of vs, it giues ſome light for the vnderſtanding of that, howe wee may bee ſayd to remitte and forgiue the treſpaſſes of our brethren,<note place="margin">How we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes of our brethren.</note> as wee are taught to pray, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not as they are properly ſinnes and tranſgreſſions of Gods Lawe, (for ſo the remiſſion of them belongs onely to the Lord, and no man is able to doe it) but wee forgiue the treſpaſſes of our brethren, as they giue to vs iuſt cauſe of complaint, as they are iniuries and wrongs, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging detriment and hurt to vs, either in bodie, goods, or good name, ſo men may remit without impeachment, or derogation from Gods glorie, a man doeth remitte the treſpaſſes of his brethren, when hee doeth forgiue the iniury and harme riſing from them to himſelfe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the conceiued anger and malice for the ſame.</p>

                  <p>Now the integrity or wholeneſſe heere ſpoken of, is to bee vnderſtood with relation, both to the vertues bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>And ſo without queſtion, the gifts and graces that were in them ſeuerally, were by loue ſo knit together in the vſe of them, as if they had beene all in one heart, and in one ſoule, and ſo by loue made as it were one perfect body: which is an excellent vſe of true Chriſtian loue to men.</p>

The moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate know but in part, and therefore their loue, and other graces that are in them, are proportionable, they are but in part, not perfect in the time of this life.</p>
                  <p>But for anſwer to that place, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.17. on which the <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Firſt, they can neuer euince and prooue it, that in that place by loue is meant that loue that is in vs, that loue wee beare either to God or man: but rather by loue is there meant Gods loue to vs that are true beleeuers, which is ſaid to be perfect in vs, in regard of the effect of it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the vſe and comfort of it, ſhed abroad in our hearts, for <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. Wee haue knowne, and beleeued the loue that God hath in vs, (or towards vs) and then he goes on ſtill, (no doubt) ſpeaking of the ſame loue, and ſaith, Heerein is that loue perfect in vs; but admit that <hi>Iohn</hi> there ſpeakes of that loue that is in vs, either towards God or men, and hee calles it perfect loue, What then? Will it thereupon follow, that there is an abſolute perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of loue in the regenerate, in the time of this life, and ſuch loue as hath no defect in it? No, no, their light braines deceiue them, if they ſo imagine. For by perfect loue vnderſtanding it of that loue that is in vs, he meaneth ſuch loue as is true, found, and vnfained, oppoſed to that which is hollow and hypocriticall, and thus wee finde the word <hi>(perfect)</hi> expounded <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.3. Where <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaith, Lord remember me now, how I haue walked bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, where we may eaſily ſee that by perfection of heart, hee vnderſtandeth truth and ſincerity of heart, and ſo in this place by per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect loue is meant ſound, true, and vnfained loue, and ſuch loue caſteth out feare, euen all ſlauiſh feare.</p>
                  <p>The Familiſts therefore cannot faſten it on this or any
<pb n="1028" facs="tcp:490:532"/> other place of Scripture, that there is in the regenerate, in the time of this life, an abſolute perfection of loue, wee are to renounce it as a phantaſticall conceit of ſuch as are deluded by the Spirit of error.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another ſect (I meane the Papiſts) who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this deſcription of loue, and gather from it a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. They gather that becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>(Loue is the bond of perfection.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <note place="margin">It is a falſe concluſion gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence by the Papiſts, that we are made perfect by loue, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by loue in Gods ſight.</note>That we are made perfect by loue, and iuſtified by loue in the ſight of God.</q>

                  <q>That loue ſerues as a bond to knit together all Chriſtian vertues and duties that paſſe from man to man, as it were into one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body, its a bond of perfection in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe vertues and duties that haue relation to men, and therefore it cannot bee rightly hence gathered, that loue is of vſe to make perfect in the ſight of God.</q>
                  <p>That concluſion is built on a ſandy foundation, and a miſconſtruction of the Text; but grant this vnto them which they are neuer able to prooue, that true beleeuers haue a perfect meaſure of loue, yet can it not iuſtifie them in the ſight of God; for iuſtification in Gods ſight ſtands, partly, in the remiſſion of ſinnes, and partly, in righteouſneſſe imputed, or as the Papiſts ſay, inherent righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now perfect loue in degree cannot procure remiſſion of any one ſinne, that is no part of Gods promiſe annexed to his couenant of workes, he ſaith not, doe this and thou ſhalt liue, and if thou doe it not, but breake my Law, by perfect loue thou ſhalt ſatisfie for that breach. No, no, the condition of perfect obedience in the morall Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, once broken, there can be no compenſation, or
<pb n="1029" facs="tcp:490:532"/> ſatisfaction, but by puniſhment, either in the perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, or of ſome other in his ſteed; without queſtion the actiue obedience of Chriſt was moſt exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet was not that perfect, legall, and meritorious obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his ſufficient to procure remiſſion of ſinnes, but hee muſt ouer and beſides that, ſuffer death, euen the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death of the Croſſe, and beare in his body and ſoule, the extremitie of Gods wrath, beefore hee could ſatisfie Gods iuſtice for the ſinnes of his choſen; and therefore it is ſaid, hee bare our ſinnes in his bodie on the tree, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. Wee may then ſafely ſtand on this againſt our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, that it is not loue (admit it to bee moſt perfect) that can iuſtifie vs in the ſight of God: becauſe it cannot procure remiſſion of the leaſt ſinne.</p>

Being iuſtified by faith wee haue peace towards God thorow our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.7. The peace of God which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, ſhall preſerue your hearts and mindes in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> but this peace is not heere meant: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peace, is that which wee haue, or ought to haue with men, namely, that concord and good agreement, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from loue, which we ought to haue one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and of this the Apoſtle ſpeakes in this place, as may eaſily appeare, both by the context, and by the ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle in this place.</p>
                  <p>Now this peace is called the peace of God, becauſe God is the author of it, both commanding it in his word, and working it in vs by his holy Spirit.</p>
                  <pb n="1031" facs="tcp:490:533"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(Rule in your heart)</hi> The word heere tranſlated <hi>(Rule)</hi> properly ſignifieth to rule after the manner of a Iudge, or an vmpire, it is taken from the cuſtome of the heathen, who in their publike games of wreſtling, or the like, had ſome who ſate as Iudges, and did rule and order the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or wreſtlers, and gaue to them that did beſt ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and the Apoſtles meaning is, let the peace of God preuaile ouer all your euill affections, which ſtirre you vp to diſcord and diſſention, and let it beare ſway, and haue chiefe command of them all, and keepe them vnder.</p>
                  <p>Thus then we are to conceiue the meaning of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
                  <q>And let that concord and good agreement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from loue, which you ought to haue one to another, commanded by God in his word, and wrought in you by his holy Spirit, haue the chiefe ſway, and preuaile ouer all your euill affections, by which you are ſtird vp to diſcord and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let it be as a commander ouer them all, and keepe them all in ſubiection.</q>
                  <p>Now heere, firſt we are to marke, that the Apoſtle cals the peace to which he exhorts, being that peace that is, or ought to be amongſt men, the peace of God, or Gods peace, (ſaith he) Let the peace of God, euen that peace that hath God the author, commander, and worker of it, rule in your hearts.</p>

                  <p>That the proper ſeat of holy peace is the hart, it is a ſmal thing to haue peace in our mouthes and tongues, when we haue warre in our hearts, for ſo may hypocrites, as the Prophet complained, Ierem. 9.8. yea, a man may be kept from diſcord and contention, outwardly by reſtraining grace, but if peace rule in the heart, that is a worke of Gods Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Come we to the argument the Apoſtle doth here ſubioin to his exhortation, for the enforcing of it on the Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, together with the amplification of it in theſe words <hi>(to the which ye are called in one body)</hi> the argument as wee may eaſily ſee, is from the condition of the Coloſſians, that they were called to peace as the members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therefore ought to entertaine it, and to haue it ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their hearts.</p>
                  <pb n="1037" facs="tcp:490:536"/>
                  <p>The amplification is as we ſhewed, by requiring of them another duty ſeruing for the better entertainment and continuance of peace, namely, that to that end they ſhould be <hi>Amiable</hi> or gratefull <hi>(to the which)</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to which peace of God before ſpoken of <hi>(yee are called)</hi> that is to ſay, ye are bound by your calling, as you are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and called to the profeſſion of the Goſpell, for when a man is ſayd to be called to anie dutie, thereby is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified that it is lawfull for him to doe that dutie, but that by his calling hee is bound to the performance and practiſe of it <hi>(in one body)</hi> that is, as the members of one body, being gathered and knit together, by the ſpirit of God, as members of one bodie vnder one head, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>(and be ye amiable)</hi> that is, according to the true and proper ſignification of the word, be ye gratefull or thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which is not to bee vnderſtood (as ſome would haue it) with relation to God, as if the meaning were, bee yee thankefull to God, for of that the Apoſtle ſpeakes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward verſe 17. and heere he entreats of duties that paſſe from man to man, &amp; are to be performed of man to man: it is therfore to be vnderſtood with relation to men, be ye gratefull or thankfull one to another, as well in conferring as in requiring of benefits, thus then conceiue wee theſe words, as if the Apoſtle had ſayd.</p>
                  <q>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, for why, it is a duty you are bound to, as you are called to bee true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the Goſpell, gathered and knit together by the ſpirit of God, as members into one body, vnder one head Chriſt Ieſus, and that you may better entertaine and continue this peace among you, be ye gratefull one to another, aſwell in conferring, as in requiring of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</q>
                  <p>Firſt, we are heere to marke that the Apoſtle doth vrge peace on the Coloſſians, &amp; perſwade them to it, by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from their Chriſtian calling, that they were called to it, in that they were Chriſtians, and profeſſors of

                  <p>That the remembrance, and confideration of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian calling and profeſſion, ought to ſway and preuaile with vs, to mooue vs to holy duties.

                  <p>Come we to the words of this verſe, and firſt of theſe words <hi>(Let the words of Chriſt dwell in you plenteouſly in all wiſdome.)</hi> The word of Chriſt doth in ſpeciall ſignifie the Goſpel, the doctrine of grace and reconciliation with God in, and thorow Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But heere it is to be taken in a larger ſenſe and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen for the whole written word of God,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that being giuen by inſpiration of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and profitable to the vſes heere limited, and ſpecified, to teach and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh. Now the whole Scripture is called the word of Chriſt, both becauſe he is the author of it, for hee it was that ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, it was the Lord Chriſt that ſent <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, as may plainly appeare by conference of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 6.9.10. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.40.41. and ſo he ſent other Prophets ſucceſſiuely time after time: and becauſe he is the matter and ende of the whole Scripture, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.46. <hi>Moſes</hi> wrot of him, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and in the ceremony of the <hi>Paſchall Lambe,</hi> in the <hi>type of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> the <hi>Arke,</hi> all <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the <hi>braſen Serpent;</hi> yea, the whole Scripture propounds Chriſt to vs the onely media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Sauiour, and to him is the whole Scripture refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the end of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He is the end of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Law was our Scholemaſter</hi> to bring vs to Chriſt, and doth leade vs to Chriſt; and for theſe reaſons is it that the whole Scripture is called the word of Chriſt, <hi>(dwell)</hi> the word heere tranſlated <hi>(dwell)</hi> properly ſignifies to inhabite, or dwell as a domeſticke, as one of the ſame houſe,; it is a Metaphor taken from ſuch as dwell vnder one and the ſame roofe with vs, who
<pb n="1046" facs="tcp:490:541"/> who are beſt knowne to vs, and moſt familiar with vs, and the Apoſtles meaning is, that the word of God ſhould bee as well knowne and familiar to vs, as he or ſhee that dwels with vs in one and the ſame houſe, <hi>(in you)</hi> that is, amongſt you; let it dwell amongſt you, and bee familiar to you, <hi>(plenteouſly)</hi> that is, in aboundance and great meaſure, <hi>(in all wiſdome)</hi> that is, in true and ſound wiſdome; it is vſuall in Scripture to put the note of vniuerſalitie <hi>(all)</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie excellency, perfection, truth, and ſoundneſſe. And the wiſdome heere ſpoken of, is not the wiſdome of the word it ſelfe, but the wiſdome that ought to bee in them, to whom the word is familiar; and the Apoſtles meaning is, that they ſhould be wiſe in the vnderſtanding and vſe of the word, being familiar to them, that they ſhould wiſely vnderſtand it, and wiſely vſe it.</p>
                  <p>Thus then wee are to conceiue theſe wordes, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
                  <q>Let a plentifull meaſure of the written word of God be as familiar,<note place="margin">Meaning of the text.</note> and well knowne to you, as a dweller with you in one and the ſame houſe, ſo as in true wiſdome you both vnderſtand it, and vſe it.</q>

                     <note place="margin">Obſeru.</note>Wee are heere to marke firſt of all, that the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing exhorted the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> to the mortification, and to the putting away of ſundrie vices,<note place="margin">

                  <p>He now comes to exhort them to haue the word of God familiar to them, as a meanes to make them able to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="1047" facs="tcp:490:541"/> that, to which he hath hitherto exhorted.</p>
                  <p>And hence we may take this concluſion.</p>
                  <p>That the onely effectual meanes ſeruing for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and putting away of ſinne, and for the putting on,<note place="margin">The onely ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means ſeruing for the mortification of ſinne, and for the putting on and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of vertue, is the word of God.</note> and practiſe of vertue, is the word of God, no other thing is able to make vs truely to abſtaine from ſinne, and to practiſe vertue, but onely the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Morall precepts of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and wiſe men, a good name, good company, good education, good examples, and ſuch like, though they be excellent things, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vſe, yet they are not able to doe this, to make vs truly to mortifie ſinne, and put on, and practiſe vertue, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the word of God is able to doe that. And hence it is, that our Sauiour praying for his Apoſtles, and all other that ſhould beleeue in him, thorow their teaching: hee ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17. Sanctifie them with the truth, thy word is truth. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.3. Yee are cleane (ſaith hee) thorow the word which I haue ſpoken vnto you. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing propounded the queſtion; wherewithal ſhal a young man redreſſe his way, as if hee had ſaid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall a man moſt vnbrideled, vntamed, and vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, come to be bridled, tamed, and reformed: hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwers himſelfe, euen by no other thing, but by the word of God, which is a plaine proofe of this point, that the word of God is the onely powerfull meanes that ſerues for the purging out, and putting away of ſinne, and for the putting on and practiſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons of this are plaine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, onely the word of God pierceth into the hearts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> men, from whence all actions good and bad proceede, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, nothing is able to make that which is ſpoken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to vs effectuall, but the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God worketh by the word, and therefore its the word of God, that is onely an effectuall meanes of the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>Hence it is plaine that Chriſt ſpeakes to vs in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <label type="milestone">

                  <p>In this verſe the Apoſtle goes on to exhort the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to other duties of the firſt Table of the commandements; as to inuocation, and calling vpon God, and to thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in this exhortation, he commends to them a generall rule, reaching to all things not ſpecified before, as if hee had ſaid, becauſe it were infinit to write to you of all things particularly, take this that I now ſet before you, as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule of al your ſayings, &amp; doings whatſoeuer: here then the Apoſtle doth vrge on the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> this generall. That whatſoeuer they did, they ſhold do it in the name of Chriſt who is deſcribed by his title Lord, &amp; by his name <hi>(Ieſus)</hi> &amp; withall the Apoſtle doth ſpecifie and expreſſe more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what hee meanes by that generall, all whatſoeuer they ſhould do (namely) all words and all deedes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (ſaith he) ye ſhall doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and he there ſtaies not, but he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requires of them, that their ſayings and doings ſhould be with thankes to God <hi>(giuing thanks to God)</hi> and that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, by ſhewing how God is to be conceiued of them in their giuing of thanks to him (namely) not only as the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of al things, but as a father, and then by whom as their mediator they ſhould preſent and offer vp their thanks to God in the laſt words, <hi>by him</hi> (namely) by Chriſt, and ſo the ſumme and ſubſtance of this verſe is an exhortation.</p>
                  <q>To ſay and do all tings whatſoeuer in the name of Chriſt, with thankes to God the Father, thorow him the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betweene God and vs.</q>
                  <p>The parts of this exhortation are theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that whatſoeuer we ſhall doe in word or deed, we do it in the name of the Lord Ieſus.</p>
                  <pb n="1078" facs="tcp:490:557"/>
                  <p>Secondly, whatſoeuer is done of vs, wee giue thankes to God by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Come we to the firſt of theſe: <hi>And whatſoeuer yee ſhall doe in word or deede, doe all in the name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> (that is) what buſineſſe ſoeuer yee ſhall enterpriſe, what matter ſoeuer yee ſhall enter vpon, and take in hand to performe. For the word (<hi>doe</hi> is heere extended by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> as we ſee, both to word and deed, and therefore wee are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his meaning largely, and generally, <hi>(in word, or deede)</hi> that is, either in ſpeech or action, <hi>(doe all)</hi> doe all thoſe buſineſſes and matters in the name of the <hi>Lord Ieſus.</hi>

                  <p>Hence preſſeth this point.</p>
                  <p>That all matters, buſineſſes, and workes wee take in <label type="milestone">

                  <p>For why? there is no matter, buſineſſe or worke we may take in hand, but that we haue either expreſſe warrant for, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or at leaſt approbation for it in the word of God, and a promiſe of a bleſſing, either direct, or by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to bee gathered, belonging to it; and therefore there is no matter, or buſineſſe wee may enter vppon, but that wee may by faith, (reſting on the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and promiſe of God) commend to God in praier.</p>
                  <p>And againe, euen in matters of buſineſſes of this world, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we muſt carrie our ſelues, not onely iuſtly, but religiouſly, ſaying and doing all we ſay or doe, as in the preſence of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1.

                  <p>But for the vſe, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> let it bee laid vp in our hearts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,<note place="margin">When we go about any matter, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe we are to conſider whether wee may comend it to God in praier, or no, &amp; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to doe it, or leaue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</note> and whenſoeuer thou goeſt about any matter, or buſines, learn then thus to debate, &amp; thus to think with thy ſelfe; is this thing that I goe now about ſuch as I may commend to the Lord in praier? May this that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, be ſaid, or may this be done in the name of the Lord Ieſus, euen with thy calling on God in his name? Surely then, I may take it in hand with cheerfulnes and comfort; but on the other ſide, is this I am now about to do, ſuch a thing, as I dare not ſet before the Lord in praier, nor call on him for a bleſſing in the name of Chriſt, or at leaſt, I doubt, whether I may ſo doe, or no?

Surely no, if they had any
<pb n="1063" facs="tcp:490:558"/> dramme of the feare of God, they would not, and therfore remember this as a rule of excellent vſe to guide thee in all things, thou takeſt in hand, either in ſpeech or action, that which thou maieſt take in hand, either to ſpeake, or doe; it muſt be ſuch as thou maieſt doe in the name of Chriſt, and commend to God in his name: and if the thing thou art about to ſpeake, or doe, bee ſuch, then goe on with boldneſſe, if it be not, take heede how thou doeſt it; and howſoeuer it may bring thee in worldly profit, yet becauſe thou canſt not commend thy worke to the Lord in praier, thou canſt not looke for a bleſſing on that profit, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, indeed, the curſe of God vpon it; yea, without thy repentance and Gods great mercy towards thee, thou ſhalt finde the curſe of God vpon that, and that beeing laid to the reſt of thy goods, euen vpon all that euer thou haſt, <hi>Habac.</hi> 2.9. And therefore euer remember this, that all matters and workes thou takeſt in hand muſt bee ſuch, as thou maieſt commend to God in praier, and ſay, the Lord for his Chriſt ſake bleſſe them, and giue good ſucceſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that offers it ſelfe to our conſideration, as a duty laid before vs in this generall rule, is this.</p>

Chapter,<note place="margin">The ſecond part of this Chapter.</note> and this part is a comprehenſion of certaine ſpeciall duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians they ſtand in relation one to another in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtate, or condition of life; it containes ſpeciall exhortations addreſſed to certaine ſorts of perſons,<note place="margin">The Apoſtles order in this part of the Chapter.</note> and particularly, and (namely) to all the ordinarie parts of a familie, both inferiours, and ſuperiours.</p>
                  <p>And therein the Apoſtle holds this order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee exhorts to the duties of thoſe that are more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> neerely and ſtraitly tyed one to another, as to the duties of husbands, and wiues, parents, and children.</p>
                  <p>And then to the duties of thoſe who are leſſe ſtraitly ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one to another, as maſters, and ſeruants: and thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he begins with the duty of inferiours, as wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſeruants, and then comes to the duties of ſuperiors, husbands, parents, and maſters.</p>
                  <p>Heere therefore, firſt the Apoſtle begins with the duty of wiues, and ſaith, <hi>Wiues ſubmit your ſelues vnto your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands as it is comely in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this verſe we haue theſe things in generall laid before vs. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wiues, to ſubmit themſelus to their husbands and that generally, or indefinitely propounded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an argument to backe and ſtrengthen that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> exhortation, taken from the decorum, comelineſſe, and decencie of it, that it is a comely and decent thing for them ſo to doe. And then,</p>
                  <pb n="1096" facs="tcp:490:566"/>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the manner of their ſubiection, or a limitation of that dutie of their ſubiection, that it muſt bee in the Lord, in the laſt words, <hi>in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(Submit your ſelues)</hi> The word properly ſignifieth, be ordered,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> or placed in order vnder another, the meaning is according to your inferiour order and place, ſubiect your ſelues, it is the ſame word with that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>(To your husbands)</hi> the words are to your owne husbands, as it is comely, or as it is meet, and as it beſeemes you <hi>(in the Lord)</hi> the meaning of that forme of ſpeech, is thus much, ſo farre foorth as it may ſtand with the true feare of God, and with your obedience to his will, ſo as you may ſtill hold piety, and good conſcience towards God, as wee may gather by the ſame phraſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39. Or thus, in things lawfull, and agreeable to the will of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thus then, conceiue wee the exhortation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as if he had ſaid,
<q>Wiues according to your inferiour order and place,<note place="margin">The meaning of the text.</note> ſubiect your ſelues to your owne Husbands ſuffer your ſelues to be ordered by them, as it is meet, and beſeemes you, ſo farre foorth as may ſtand with the true feare of God, and obedience to his will in things lawfull, and agreeable to the will of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come we now to the matter of the doctrine; and firſt obſerue we,<note place="margin">Obſeru.</note> that the Apoſtle hauing exhorted to generall duties that concerne all Chriſtians, as they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; he there ſtaies not, but comes now to exhort to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall duties, that concerne certaine ſorts of perſons parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; hee comes to exhort to the duties that concerne Chriſtians in their perſonall eſtates, and conditions of life.</p>
                  <p>Hence we are taught thus much.</p>
                  <p>That it is not enough for a Chriſtian to carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="1097" facs="tcp:490:566"/> well, and as a Chriſtian in the generall duties of a Chriſtian, but hee muſt alſo behaue himſelfe Chriſtianly in the ſpeciall duties of his ſpeciall calling.<note place="margin">A Chriſtian muſt not only carrie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe well in the generall duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but alſo in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall duties of his ſpeciall calling.</note> Its not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a Chriſtian to be of good conuerſation abroad, but his behauiour muſt be alſo good and ſuch as it ought to be at home.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is that the holy Ghoſt directs his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeuerall ſorts of perſons (eſpecially in the family) to carrie themſelues holily and iuſtly, not onely heere, but in other places of Scripture, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. &amp; 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſons of this are manifeſt, <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, euery Chriſtian hauing two callings: one general <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be a Chriſtian, and the other ſpeciall, as to bee an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, a wife, a father, &amp;c. and both theſe of God, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooues him that he carry himſelfe well, both in the one, and in the other, if he will approue himſelfe to God.</p>
                  <p>And againe, euery Chriſtian beſides his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtanding, in which hee is to withſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, and to ſet himſelfe againſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſinne common to him with others, hee hath his peculiar place and ſtanding appointed him by the Lord, in which he is to bend his force, and to ſtriue againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations to ſinne proper to that place, ſuch temptations as are laid againſt him in that his peculiar place and calling, and it is meet that he ſhew himſelfe faithfull in them both, that both in his generall and peculiar calling, he withſtand temptations to ſinne, and therefore a Chriſtian muſt not onely carrie himſelfe well in the generall duties of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but he muſt alſo demeane himſelfe as a Chriſtian in the duties of his particular ſtate and condition of life.</p>
                  <p>They therefore are iuſtly to bee blamed and reprooued <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> who happily make a faire ſhew of good conuerſation in their generall calling,<note place="margin">Reproofe of thoſe who carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues well in ſhew in their generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and yet faile in the duties of their ſpeciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> and yet carrie themſelues badly in their ſpeciall, they who would faine ſeeme to bee good Chriſtians abroad, and yet behaue themſelues wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="1098" facs="tcp:490:567"/> at home, too many ſuch there be in the world. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, look vpon a people aſſembled to heare the word of God, and you ſhall ſee, there is almoſt no man or woman amongſt them but they carrie themſelues reuerently, all, and euery one almoſt is a like reuerent and attentiue in hearing the word, and euery one almoſt, ſeemes to make conſcience of that generall dutie in the Church, but goe home with many of them to their houſes, and looke into their conuerſation at home, and there you ſhall eaſily ſee they make no conſcience of their ſpeciall duties, of duties that concerne them in their particular ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, there you ſhall ſee either the wife refuſing to ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband, or the husband bitter to his wife, the children ſtubborne and diſobedient to their parents, or the parents too indulgent, or too rigorous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their children; ſeruants refractarie and careleſſe in their duties, or maſters vniuſt and vnequall in their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings toward their ſeruants; yea, in ſome houſes you ſhal ſee all parts out of order, both husband, wife, and all the reſt, neglecting the duties of their particular place and ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And againe, are there not ſome who carry themſelues in Chriſtian duties, which they owe to men; well, and without exception towards moſt men abroad in publike, but towards them, to whom they ſtand in ſome ſpeciall relation, wretchedly, and wickedly? As the wife carries her ſelfe well, and in ſome tolerable ſort towards all, ſaue to her husband, and the husband demeanes himſelfe well, and giues ſome content to all ſaue his wife, and ſo in other relations.</p>
                  <p>Now conſider we this, is this to carrie our ſelues as Chriſtians ought to doe? No, no, this is but the forme of godlineſſe without the power of it, as the apoſtle calles it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. this is but meere hypocriſie; is it like thou behaueſt thy ſelfe well (for conſcience ſake) towards them to whom thou oweſt but a generall duty, and not to thoſe

                  <p>Obſerue further that the Apoſtle in ſetting downe the ſpeciall duties of ſeuerall ſorts of perſons, hee begins firſt with the inferiours, as firſt hee teacheth the duety of wiues and then of Husbands &amp;c. and this order hee obſerues in other places, heereby teaching vs.</p>

                  <p>And againe, her ſubiection to her husband muſt bee in obedience to him, doing what hee giues in charge to bee done, and forbearing to doe that hee forbiddes, wee find that both theſe were in <hi>Sara</hi> towards <hi>Abraham,</hi> her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, 1.

                  <p>Now the extent of the wiues ſubiection,<note place="margin">The duty of ſubiection in the wife to her husband rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to all wiues whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be.</note> the third thing that I propounded to ſpeake of, is implied in the firſt words of this verſe <hi>(Wiues)</hi> in that the Apoſtle ſpeakes generally and indefinitely, and ſaith, wiues ſubiect your ſelues to your husbands, hee giues vs to vnderſtand.</p>
                  <p>That this duty of ſubiection is generall and common,
<pb n="1102" facs="tcp:490:569"/> and reacheth to all wiues, high or low, rich or poore, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or baſe, and there is no exemption of any wife what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe be, from this duty of ſubiection to her husband, though the wife bee very wiſe, and more fit to gouerne, and the husband of meaner parts and weaker iudgement, if hee haue any vſe of reaſon at all, if hee bee not a man franticke or madde, one altogether bereft of the vſe of reaſon; if hee be ſo, then doubtleſſe the wife is not bound to ſubiect her ſelfe to his gouernement, but rather to take on her to bee his guide and his gouernour, for the power of gouernment beeing taken away, ſubiection depending on it, ceaſeth; but if hee haue the vſe of reaſon, bee it but in a ſmall meaſure, ſhee is not exempt from ſubiection, though ſhee bee neuer ſo wiſe, if ſhee bee a wife, ſhee muſt bee ſubiect, ſhee muſt yeeld reuerence and obedience to her husband, vnleſſe ſhee will ſhake off the yoke the Lord hath layd on her necke, and breake in ſunder the cords of Gods holy ordinance.</p>

Some there be, who ſticke not to vtter it, that they will doe this or that, yea ſometimes they binde it with an oath, they will doe it, let their husbands ſay what they can to the contrary, or they will not doe that hee would haue them (being a thing lawfull) though hee would neuer ſo faine; to inſiſt in one particular, are there not ſome wiues, who if their husbands bid them leaue of this or that apparell, as too fine or coſtly in the matter, or too gariſh in the manner, will preſently anſwer him they will not? yea, ſome are ſo ſhameleſſe, as to anſwer in this manner, let him ſay or doe what hee can, I will haue it ſo, thus, and many wayes beſides, wiues diſcouer the rebellion of their hearts, in vnreuerent and vndutifull behauiour towards their husbands, yea, they are hardly drawen to this duety of ſubiection, it is an hard matter to perſwade them to it, becauſe the wife is yoke-fellow with her husband, and neerely knit to him, euen one fleſh with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many wiues thinke it vnreaſonable, and too much laid on them, in that they are inioined to be ſubiect to their husbands.<note place="margin">Foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade wiues to performe their duty to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then to perſwade with them to yeeld to this duty, let them conſider onely theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſuch wiues as refuſe to ſubiect themſelues to their husbands, inuert the order of nature, it is as if the bodie ſhould refuſe to be guided by the head.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they breake the ordinance of God, yea, a moſt ancient ordinance of God, for euen in mans inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,

                  <p>Thirdly, conſider the Apoſtles wordes in this place, that it is a comely thing for the wife to bee ſubiect to her husband, and the want of this or the contrary to it, is an vncomely and vnſeemely thing, ſeeſt thou a woman not ſubiect to her husband? ſhee is an vncomely and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome creature in the ſight of God, though her face be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo faire, her beauty is but as a ring of gold in a ſwines ſnout, Prou. 11.22.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, the want of ſubiection in the wife to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is as the want of teaching in a Miniſter, and the want of iuſtice in a Magiſtrate, it is a blot and blemiſh to all her other good qualities and vertues bee they neuer ſo excellent, admit ſhee bee deſcreete, chaſte, ſober, &amp;c. yet if ſhee bee not ſubiect to her husband, ſhee cauſeth the worde of God to bee ill ſpoken of, Tit. 2.5. and that makes all her other good qualities nothing woorth, it brings a blot on them all, ſeeme ſhee neuer ſo religious, if ſhee bee not ſubiect to her husband, ſhee hath but a ſhew of religion without the power of it.</p>
                  <p>Let all Chriſtian wiues thinke on theſe things, it is not ſo light a matter as many women thinke, to bee vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and vndutifull towardes their husbands, thereby they preuert the order of nature, they vioiate the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, they make themſelues odious in the ſight of God, they blemiſh all the good things that are in them, yea, thereby they make it plaine, that their religion is but a

                  <p>Now, for the husbands loue to the ſoule of his wife that ſtands eſpecially in two things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that which we are taught, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. <hi>That he dwell with his wife as a man of knowledge:</hi> the husband being the wiues head ought to be more eminent, and to appeare aboue her in wiſdome, iudgement, and diſcretion, and the feare of God, and according to his height and meaſure in thoſe good things, to bend downe, and to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, either to implant the ſame, or to increaſe them, being already implanted in his wife. Husbands ſometimes complaine that their wiues are vnruly, and carrie not themſelues as they ought towards them, when indeed, the fault is from themſelues, becauſe they ſhould dwell with them, as men of wiſdome, and knowledge, and doe not; its as if the head which hath the guiding of the body, ſhould leade it thorow briers, and thornes, and cauſe it to bee ſcratched, and then complaine that the armes, or legges, did ake, or ſmart; for the husband is the wiues head, and ſhould wiſely lead her, and goe in and out before her.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing wherein ſtands the husbands loue to the ſoule of his wife is compriſed vnder a generall duty, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.2. the husband is to carrie an equall minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his wife, and that is, eſpecially in bearing with her
<pb n="1112" facs="tcp:490:574"/> frailties and infirmities, as with her haſtineſſe, or ſlowneſſe, her importunity, and ſuch like; The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the place before cited, ſaith, Let the husband giue honour vnto the woman as vnto the weaker veſſell; let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her with mildneſſe, and gentleneſſe, bearing with her naturall weakeneſſe and infimities, and if ſhee fall by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion into any fault (except Adulterie, which is the bane of wedlocke) let him labour by all kinde and gentle meanes, to reclaime her, conſidering himſelfe, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. that he alſo may bee tempted, and fall into the like ſinne.</p>

                  <p>Fourthlie, how farre foorth it is to bee yeelded by children to their Parents, and then after ſome application of things deliuered, I will bring ſome motiues to ſtirre vp children to the practiſe of it.<note place="margin">Childrens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their Parents deſcribed.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore knowe that this obedience is a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heartie yeelding (ſo farre foorth as children are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to the voyce and willes of their Parents, a yeelding from the heart willingly (as they are able) to that which is ſaid by Parents to children, and by Parents, willed to bee done or ſuffered of their children. I ſay a voluntary and hearty yeelding, for that is the condition of all true ſound and ſincere obedience both to God and man, and ſo it ought to bee qualified, if it be forced, it is no true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is then but as the obedience of Deuils and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, who, will they, nill they, are ſubiect to the will of God, yea both doe and ſuffer what the diuine prouidence hath appointed, and if it be a yeelding with grudging, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, or the leaſt repining, it is no ſound obedience, and therefore childrens obedience to their parents muſt be a voluntary and hearty yeelding (as they are able) to that which is ſaid and willed by them to be done or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their children.</p>
                  <p>Now this willing and hearty yeelding of children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the voice and will of their parents, ſtandeth in two things.<note place="margin">Childrens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their Parents, ſtands in two things.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, the yeelding of children to their Parents ſtands in a quiet and patient ſuffering of that which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents inflict and lay vppon them in worde or deede, bee it admonition, reproofe or correction, yea, though the correction bee with iuſt cauſe, or more exceſſiue then it ought to bee, Prouerbs the thirteenth and firſt, A wiſe ſonne will obey the inſtruction of his father, but a ſcorner will heare no rebuke, Prouerbs 15.5.

                  <p>And againe, Parents are bound, yea, it is a duty lying on them to rebuke and correct the children offending, and therefore it is a duty of children to ſubmit themſelues to their rebukes and chaſticements: that is one part of their obedience.</p>

                  <p>Conſider wee yet further, the ground of the Apoſtles reaſon in this place; he ſaith, <hi>Children obey your Parents in all things, for that is wel-pleaſing to the Lord:</hi> What is the ground of this? How knew the Apoſtle that Obedience to Parents is a thing well-pleaſing to God? Surely, hee knew it from the Commandement of God, becauſe ſuch obedience is commanded in the 5. Commandement, and he knew it to be in an high degree well-pleaſing to God, becauſe that comandement is as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2. The firſt Commandement (namely) of thoſe that concerne our duty to men, and the firſt Commandement with promiſe, with a ſpeciall promiſe annexed to it, that thy daies may bee prolonged vpon the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee. Hence it was that our Apoſtle knew this duty of obedience to parents to be wel-pleaſing, yea, better pleaſing to God then any other dutie of the
<pb n="1131" facs="tcp:490:583"/> ſeconde Table, and this reaſon thus conſidered with theſe groundes of it dooth affoord vnto vs this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>That Gods good lykinge of any thinge, is to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from his will reuealed,<note place="margin">Gods good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any thing, is to be gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his will reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> we muſt gather the good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and aprobation of the Lorde, that hee likes, and that hee approues, this or that thing, from his word.</p>
                  <p>For in deede, what hee willeth in his worde, that hee liketh, his will there reuealed being the rule of all our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and goodnes: nothing done by vs, is holy &amp; good &amp; pleaſing to him, but that which he there willeth. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle puts them together. Ro. 12.2. that wee may proue what is the good will of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and perfect, what God willeth, being good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee wils it, and being willed by him and ſoe good, is alſo acceptable and pleaſing to him. <hi>Micha.</hi> 6.6.7. The prophet bringes in man thus demaundinge, where-with ſhall I come before the Lord, and how ſhall I bowe my ſelfe before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, and calues of a yeere old? will the Lorde be pleaſed with thouſands of rams, or with ten thouſand riuers of oyle? ſhall I giue my firſt borne, for my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: euen the fruite of my body, for the ſinne of my ſoule? will theſe thinges pleaſe the Lord? and then <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. The prophet anſweres, hee hath ſhewed thee ô man what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe iuſtlie, and to loue mercie, and to humble thy ſelfe to walke with thy God: as if hee had ſaide, that which the LORD hath ſhewed, and reuealed to thee to bee good, and that which hee requires of thee in his word, that is the thing that is pleaſing to him.</p>
                  <p>Now then is it ſoe that the LORDES good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, and approbation of any thinge, &amp; that hee likes this or that, and is pleaſed with it, is to bee gathered from his will reuealed.</p>
                  <p>I might then apply this to diſcouer the folly of the

                  <p>Thus then wee are to conceiue the Apoſtles meaning in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſayd.</p>
                  <q>You that are naturall Parents, and eſpecially you fathers, doe not you abuſe your fatherly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer your children, doe not you any way exaſperate and ſtirre vp your children to anger, vſe not you any hard and rigorous dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, whereby they may haue occaſion to be ſtirred vp to vniuſt and ſinnefull anger; leaſt you ſo doing, your childrens mindes bee deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in them, and they put clean out of hart, and loſe all courage and comfort, and euen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of doing any thing pleaſing vnto you.</q>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, thy child deſeruing correction, doe not thou flie vpon him in a paſſion, that bewraies more then brutiſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but ſeriouſly conſider with thy ſelfe, the nature and qualitie of the offence, and how often, or ſeldome thy childe hath ſo offended, and accordinly fit thy correction as neere as thou canſt.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, correct thy childe with compaſſion in thine heart, euen with yearning bowels in the doing of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with thy ſelfe, that happily the frowarneſſe, or curſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and particular euill qualitie that is found in thy child hath been tranſmitted and conuaied from thee vnto him, and thou correcting thy childe, doſt but puniſh thine owne ſinne in thy childe; thinke with thy ſelfe, ſhall I thus puniſh mine owne ſinne, and that in my childe? Shall I thus proſecute the corruption that I haue conuaid to my childe?</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, let the chaſtiſement of thy child be with a lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of thine heart to God in praier, that he hee would
<pb n="1141" facs="tcp:490:588"/> giue thee a wiſe heart to giue correction, and thy childe a ſoft heart to receiue it with patience, and to profitte by it.</p>
                  <p>And if theſe rules be obſerued of thee in the correcting of thy childe, doubtleſſe thou ſhalt doe it with mildneſſe, and without rigour, and thou ſhalt doe it with profit to thy child, and with comfort to thy ſelfe; yea, thy child in ſuch manner corrected will giue pleaſures to thy ſoule, <hi>Prou.</hi> 29.17. Hee will vtter ſuch gracious ſpeaches, doe ſuch righteous deeds, and haue ſuch comely geſtures, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ſuch obedience and thankfullneſſe towards thee, as ſhall much delight thy ſoule; therefore remember the rules propounded.</p>
                  <p>Marke we further, the Apoſtle laieth downe his prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in theſe termes: <hi>Prouoke not your children to anger:</hi> Where we ſee, that howſoeuer children are not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to vniuſt anger, and if they bee, they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelues, that they are thereunto prouoked, yet Parents are not to giue them occaſion of ſuch anger; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are not to ſtirre them vp to it by their rigorus dealing with them.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>(Seruants)</hi> In the time of the Apoſtle when hee writ this Epiſtle,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> ſuch were properlie cald <hi>(Seruants)</hi> as were taken in warre, and kept in bondage, or ſuch as were bought with money, and indeed ſlaues to their maſters, but wee are to take the word in a larger ſenſe, for ſeruants of any ſort whoſoeuer, euen ſuch as our ſeruants are, who ſerue for wages, or as Aprentices, <hi>(be obedient)</hi> the original word heere vſed is the ſame we had, verſe 20. and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is the ſame; Seruants liſten and hearken to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and yeeld to them, and obey them in that they ſay, or doe to you, <hi>(according to the fleſh)</hi> theſe words haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the word <hi>(Maſters)</hi> Maſters according to the fleſh, and the meaning is, to your maſters who haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er onely ouer your bodies and not ouer your ſoules and conſciences <hi>(in all things)</hi> that is, in all things your maſters ſay, or doe to you, being things honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for ſo much is implied in that maſters haue power onely ouer the bodies of their ſeruants, and not ouer their ſoules, ſo as if the maſter command his ſeruant any thing againſt the libertie of a good conſcience, he is not therein to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Thus then wee are to conceiue the meaning of theſe words, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
                  <q>You that are ſeruants of any ſort whatſoeuer, doe you yeelde to that which is ſaid, or done to you by your Maſters, who haue power ouer your bodies, but not ouer your ſoules and conſciences, yeelde to them entire obedience, obey them in all things, honeſt and lawfull.</q>

Chriſt ſets downe this clearely, ween he ſaith, <hi>Which of you is it that hauing a ſeruant plowing, or feeding cattell, would ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by and by, when he were come from the field, goe, and ſit downe at table:</hi> as if hee had ſaid, if a ſeruant that hath beene toiling all the day long in following the plow, or the like labour, at night when he comes home wearie and hungrie, be commanded by his maſter a further ſeruice, hee is not to refuſe to doe it, he is ſtill to doe what his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter commands him.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the yeelding of a ſeruant to the will of his maſter is in a meeke and patient bearing of that rebuke, or correction that is laid on him by his maſter, yea, though the correction be without iuſt cauſe, or vnreaſonable, and more exceſſiue then it ought to be. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Seruants</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>be ſubiect to your Maſters with all feare,</hi> not onely to the good and courteous, but alſo to the froward, euen to ſuch as are froward, crabbed, and peruerſe, and wrongfully buffet you, for ſo it followes, verſ. 20.21. <hi>For what praiſe is it, if when ye bee buffeted for your faults yee take it patiently? but and if yee doe well, yee ſuffer wrong and take</hi>
                     <pb n="1147" facs="tcp:490:591"/> it patiently, this is acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p>Seruants are in ſilence to ſuffer the checks and rebukes of their maſters, not anſwering againe as it is Tit. 2.9. not muttering or murmuring, not giuing one word for another, and they are patiently to beare that correction that is laid on them by their maſters, though it bee vniuſt or exceſſiue, and therefore ſay not then, being a ſeruant, when thou art vniuſtly corrected, I deſerue not to bee ſo roughly dealt withall, but remember thou deſerueſt more at Gods hand for ſome other ſinne, and the hand of thy maſter is but the inſtrument of God, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or correction of that other ſinne which is in thee.</p>
                  <p>Now for the perſons whom this duty concernes,<note place="margin">The duty of obedience to maſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be.</note> that is layd downe in the firſt word <hi>(Seruants)</hi> the Apoſtle heere alſo not limiting this duetie to ſeruants, of this or that ſort, but ſaying indefinitely (ſeruants) wee are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vnderſtand that the duetie belongs to all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, whether they bee bound to their maſters, or ſerue for wages, or howſoeuer, ſay not thou, I am but a Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney man, or I am but hired for a day, or my maſter is my brother, my vncle, or my kinſman, and therefore I am not bound to ſuch duety and obedience as others, no, no, remember that <hi>Iacob</hi> ſerued his vncle <hi>Laban</hi> Geneſis the twentie nine.

                  <p>It is a general complaint that ſeruants were neuer worſe then now in theſe daies, and indeede ſcarſe one ſeruant of a thouſand makes conſcience of that obedience that is due to his maſter, where is almoſt the ſeruant to bee found that yeeldes willing and cheerefull obedience to the voice and will of his Maſter, or Miſtreſſe, or Dame, for the worde (Maſters) is to bee vnderſtood of both? where is that ſeruant that willingly doth that which is commanded by his Maſter, or Miſtreſſe or Dame, and with meekeneſſe and patience beares that rebuke or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection they lay on him or her?

                  <p>Well, let all ſeruants now call themſelues to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and examine themſelues touching this duty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towardes their maſters by that which hath beene ſaid, and finding that thou haſt heeretofore failed, bee humbled for thy failing, thy diſobedience to thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is one of thy great ſinnes, and till thou bee humbled for that, thou haſt no true repentance.</p>

                  <p>Againe, conſider that thy maſter is but thy maſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>according <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the fleſh, he hath power onlie ouer thy body, but there is a maſter in heauen who hath power ouer both bodie and ſoule, and if thou pull thy necke from vnder the yoake of thy earthlie Maſter, and refuſe to yeelde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him in thy bodie, happilie becauſe he is an hard maſter, know that ſo doing thou bringeſt both thy bodie and ſoule vnder the yoke of Gods wrath, who hath power to deſtroie them both, eternallie in hell fire, bee therefore better aduiſed, and if thou deſire to doe duties of Gods worſhip, pleaſing to God, and with comfort to thy ſelfe, if thou wouldeſt not, by eaſing thy ſelfe (as thou thinkſt) by withdrawing thy neck from vnder the yoke of this earthly maſter, (who can onlie deale hardlie with thy bodie) bring thy ſelfe vnder the heauie yoke of the wrath

                  <p>Take thou heed of this kind of reaſoning, this comes from the ſuggeſtion of Satan, and from thine owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and know it for a truth, that be thy maſter neuer ſo poore, hee hath as much authoritie ouer thee, as the greateſt man hath ouer his ſeruant, his pouerty doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing detract from his authoritie ouer thee, neither ought it to leſſen thine obedience to him, and therefore make conſcience of it to yeeld obedience to thy maſter, bee hee neuer ſo poore, or of neuer ſo meane condition in the world.

                  <p>But dooing ſeruice to your Maſters, in the ſimplicitie and truth of your hearts, without any manner of fraud or diſſembling, euen from the ſinceritie of your hearts, yeelding to your maſters, ſound, true, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice, <hi>(fearing God)</hi> (that is) carrying in your hearts as the ground of ſuch ſincere and faithfull ſeruice, a reue. rent awe and holy feare of the great and glorious Maieſtie of God, euen out of a holie loue to him, in regard of his
<pb n="1154" facs="tcp:490:595"/> mercie, and of a reuerent loue of him, in reſpect of his iudgements and fearing to offend him in any thing.</p>
                  <p>Thus then conceiue wee theſe words <hi>(not with eye-ſeruice, as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart fearing God)</hi> as if the Apoſtle had more largely ſpoken thus.</p>
                  <q>Not doing the duties and things commanded by your maſters onely, when your maſters are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and looke on you, or may come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that you doe, at othertimes being idle or remiſſe, in your buſineſſe, or doing amiſſe, as thoſe who onely care to pleaſe men, and to giue them contentment and looke no further; but doe you euen from the ſincerity of your hearts, yeeld to your Maſters, ſound, true and faithfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſeruice, euer carrying in your hearts a reuerent awe and holy feare of God, euen of a true loue to him for his mercie, and of a reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent awe of him in reſpect of his iudgements, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to offend him in any thing.</q>

                  <p>That they muſt not onely yeelde obedience to their maſters &amp; do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruice, but they muſt do it in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it ought to bee done, and in ſpeciall, their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſeruice muſt bee qualified as the Apoſtle hath heere expreſſed, it muſt not bee eye-ſeruice, obedience to the eye of the maſters, but ſingle hearted ſeruice and ſincere, comming from the feare of God, ſeruants muſt yeelde to their maſters true and faithfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they muſt doe them ſeruice truely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

                  <p>Wil we ſee ſome examples of true and faithful ſeruice in both theſe kindes. Looke vpon <hi>Ioſeph, Geneſ.</hi> 39. hee no doubt was diligent in the workes of his maſters ſeruice, as we may gather by the Lords bleſſing on his labours, hee was alſo carefull of his maſters goods, inſomuch as the text ſaith verſe 6. That his maſter left all that he had in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> hand, and tooke account of nothing that was with him, and verſe 8. That his maſter knew not what he had in the houſe with him, but committed al that he had to his hand.</p>
                  <p>But moſt excellent and memorable in this kind, is the example of <hi>Iacob, Gene.</hi> 31. verſ. 38. to ende of verſe 40. This 20. yeeres, ſaith <hi>Iacob,</hi> haue I beene with thee, thine ewes &amp; thy goats haue not caſt their young, and the rams of the flocke haue I not eaten. Verſe 39. Whatſoeuer was torne of beaſts I brought it not to thee, but made it good my ſelfe, of mine hand didſt thou require it, were it ſtollen by day, or ſtollen by night. There was his faithfull care for the the goods of his Maſter, he was ſo farre from pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring any thing from his maſter, as hee made good that which was loſt, and for his paines and diligence, hee ſaith, That hee was in the day conſumed with heate, and with froſt in the night, and his ſleepe departed from him. Heere is indeed an example of ſingle hearted, and faithful ſeruice yeelded by a ſeruant to his maſter; let all ſeruants looke on this example, and conſider it, and if they duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der it, and thereby examine their owne practiſe, no doubt it will conuince moſt ſeruants of vnfaithfulneſſe towards their maſters.</p>

                  <p>That they muſt doe all their workes, in the ſeruice of their maſters, from the heart willinglie:<note place="margin">Seruants muſt doe the workes of their Maſters, from their hearts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</note> whatſoeuer they doe in the ſeruice of their Maſters, bee it greate or ſmall, bee it pleaſinge, or diſpleaſinge to themſelues, they muſt doe it from their verie heart and ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Howſoeuer the ſeruantes ſoule be free, and the Maſter hath not power ouer it: Yet the beginninge of all good ſeruice, from ſeruantes to their Maſters, is in the heart, and ſoule: and from thence it muſt come, and this is not onely cleare from this text, but alſo from that Epheſ. 6.6. Where the Apoſtle ſaith to ſeruantes: bee obedient to your Maſters, not as men-pleaſers, but as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of Chriſt, doinge the will of GOD from the heart.</p>
                  <pb n="1164" facs="tcp:490:600"/>
                  <p>And the reaſon and ground of this, is that generall truth that it is no true ſeruice or obedience either to God or men, that is not willinglie performed, there is a neede full worke of the heart and ſoule in euerie ſeruice and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie done, whether to God or men, and if the dutie done, bee either forced or done with a grudging heart, it is no <label type="milestone">

<pb n="1165" facs="tcp:490:600"/> and a good duty commanded in his word, if any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious thing bee done it is not pleaſing to him, though it be done from the verie heart and ſoule, and with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good intention, and with the greateſt deuotion that may bee, the Lord then regards not the heart, and motion of it, but in doing of any good duty, hee rather looks to the heart, and to the affection of the doer then to the thing done, and onely that good dutie is pleaſing to him, which is done heartily, euen from the very heart and ſoule, 1. Corinth. 9.17. and therefore take heede thou be not poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of ſlumber in doing of anie good thing, that is the character and badge of a carnall and drowſie profeſſour, but labour thou to haue thy heart quickened by grace, that whatſoeuer good thing thou doeſt either in the immediate worſhippe of God, or to thy brethren, thou muſt doe it with alacritie and cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and from the very heart roote, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks Phillippians the firſt and the eighth, for that is onlie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that comes to be conſidered is this, the Apoſtle hauing ſaid to ſeruants, whatſoeuer ye doe in the ſeruice of your maſters, doe it heartilie, hee addes further (as the meanes whereby they may come to doe ſo, this conſideration, that in doing ſeruice to their maſters, they doe it not barelie to men alone, but in them to the Lord, their maſters (as they are maſters) bearing the image of God, ſtanding in his ſteed.</p>
                  <p>Hence ſeruants are taught.</p>
                  <p>That they muſt diſcern the image of God in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> that they may do willing &amp; harty<note place="margin">Seruants muſt diſcerne Gods image in their maſters that they may ſerue them willingly and heartily.</note> ſeruice vnto them, they muſt conſider that their maſters are in Gods roome to them, and ſtand in Chriſt his ſtead, as his vicegerents in the familie, and they commanding anie lawfull thing, it is Chriſt that commands it.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the Apoſtle doth exhort ſeruants Eph. 6.5.6. to be obedient to their maſters as vnto Chriſt, and

                  <p>Now that is called both a reward and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a reward, both by way of ſimilitude, becauſe it is giuen as wages is wont to be giuen to workemen, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers at the end of their labours, when their worke is finiſhed, then commonly they receiue their hire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; ſo when Gods children haue finiſhed their courſe, and paſſed thorow the labours and miſeries of this life, they receiue eternall life. Whence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.9. ſaith; They receiue the end of their faith, euen the ſaluation of their ſoules. And in this ſimilitude, and reſemblance is eternall life cald a reward, and alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe beeing promiſed by God to his children, it is duely and iuſtly rendred to them vpon his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, eternall life is cald an inheritance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it belonges, and is, and ſhall bee giuen to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren euen to ſuch as are his adopted children in Chriſt, who hauing receiued the adoption of ſons, are the heires of God thorow Chriſt, as we haue it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7. and as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. Being children are alſo heires, euen the heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt, yea ioint heires with Chriſt the naturall Son of God, of whoſe body they are members, and ſo are heires of ſaluation, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. and life eternal is their proper inheritance, and therefore ſo called in this, and in many other places of Scripture, <hi>(For you ſerue the Lord Chriſt)</hi> that is, in ſeruing of your maſters, you ſerue not them alone, but in them the Lord Chriſt, your maſters ſtanding in his ſteede, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt taks your ſeruice as done to himſelf, thus then we are to conceiue the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="1172" facs="tcp:490:604"/>You Seruant doe as faithfull and hearty ſeruice to your Maſters, as you would doe to the Lord, certainly knowing and being aſſured of it, that you (doing your dutie) when you haue gone thorow the labours of this life, of the Lord yee ſhall receiue eternall life, and ſaluation in his kingdome of glory, as the promiſed reward due to all his faithfull ſeruants which is an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that he will beſtow on you as on his adopted children in Chriſt, for in ſeruing of your maſters, you ſerue the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and hee takes your ſeruice as done to himſelfe.</q>
                  <p>Firſt, we are heere to marke, that the Apoſtle doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſeruants to be obedient to their maſters, and to ſerue them in ſingleneſſe of heart, doing euery thing in the ſeruice of them, as to the Lord, by an argument from the rich reward of their ſeruice, that of the Lord they ſhall receiue no leſſe then the reward of eternall life.</p>

                  <p>And this is grounded vpon that generall, that in doing good duties, men of any calling or condition may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue reſpect to the recompence of eternall reward, as it is expreſſely ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> had, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26.

                  <p>In the next place wee are to marke the Apoſtles firſt amplification of his argument in the wordes of this verſe? <hi>(Knowing)</hi> Hee ſaith not barely, for of the Lord, he ſhall receiue the reward of the inheritance, but knowing it, you beleeuing ſeruants doing your dutie as

                  <p>Hence we may raiſe this concluſion.</p>

                  <p>And the reaſon and ground of this is.

Loue of the brethren, a fruit of the Spirit, giues aſſurance of tranſlation from death to life, that men are ſet out of the ſtate of nature which is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and are now in the ſtate of grace.</p>

                  <p>For wee knowe, an inheritance is freelie giuen by the father, to the childe, and not deſerued by any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of welldoinge: it is giuen by the father to the childe, of the meere loue of the father; and it may be it was prouided for him, beefore hee was borne, or beefore hee coulde doe any thinge for it: and ſoe our Sauiour ſpeakes playnelie of the heauenlie inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.

                  <p>And this argument is further amplified by the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord in giuing iudgement (namely) this, that he is a righteous and impartiall iudge, not reſpecting any mans perſon; in the laſt words, and there is no reſpect of perſons.</p>

                     <l>That which is equall.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And theſe two things, the Apoſtle doth vrge on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by way of exhortation, generally propounded in theſe words <hi>(Yee Maſters doe to your Seruants that which is equall.)</hi> And then hee ſtrengthens this exhortation, and moues maſters to the doing of theſe two things, by force of argument, and that taken from their ſubiection to an higher Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <q>That they are not abſolute Maſters, and ſubiect to none, but that they alſo haue a Maſter aboue them, to whoſe cenſure they are ſubiect, and to whom they muſt one day yeeld an account (as of all their doings) ſo of their dealings with their Seruants.</q>
                  <p>And this argument the Apoſtle doth amplifie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by their own knowledge, (or at leaſt, they ought to know, and conſider it) <hi>Knowing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that yee alſo haue a Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, by ſetting downe what Maſter it is they haue aboue them (namely) not an earthly, but an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Maſter</p>
                  <p>And ſo the generall things before vs in this Verſe, are theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a generall exhortation to Maſters to doe to their ſeruants, <hi>that which is iuſt and equall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, a reaſon to ſtrengthen that exhortation, and to preſſe theſe duties on them (namely) this, becauſe Maſters know (or at leaſt, ought to know) that they are not abſolute Maſters, and ſubiect to none, but haue alſo an heauenly Lord and Maſter aboue them, to whoſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they are ſubiect, and to whom they muſt one day render an account.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe two things in order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>What we are to vnderſtand by Maſters and Seruants we heard before in the 22. Verſe of the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (namely) ſuch as are maſters according to the fleſh,
<pb n="1205" facs="tcp:490:620"/> and ſuch are ſeruants for wages, terme of yeeres, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. <hi>(Doe)</hi> the word properly ſignifies, exhibite, or yeeld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Thus then conceiue the meaning of this exhortation.</p>
                  <q>You that are Maſters according to the fleſh, yeeld to your Seruants, that you are bound vnto, and of right ought to yeelde vnto them, vnleſſe you will doe them wrong, and deale vniuſtly with them, and that alſo that becommeth you to yeeld to them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in equity, piety, and good conſcience. <label type="milestone">

                  </q>
                  <p>Now, firſt the duty of Maſters towards their ſeruants<note place="margin">The dutie of maſters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſeruants.</note> heere expreſſed comes to be further conſidered.</p>
                  <p>In handling of it, I will firſt lay foorth the particulars wherein the iuſt dealing of Maſters towards their ſeruants conſiſteth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the particular things which Maſters are of right <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to yeeld to their Seruants.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſpeciall things wherein ſtands their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> dealing with their ſeruants; and what bee the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that Maſters are to yeeld to their Seruants in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I will ſhew the extent of the dutie touching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the perſons, (namely) who bee the Maſters that are to deale iuſtly and conſcionably with their Seruants.</p>
                  <p>And then after ſome examination, I will bring ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> motiues to ſtirre them vp whom this dutie concernes to the practiſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, know we, that Maſters are of right to yeeld to their ſeruants three things, their iuſt dealing with their Seruants ſtands in three things.<note place="margin">The iuſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of maſters with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ſtands in 3. things.</note>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="1246" facs="tcp:490:621"/>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in requiring of them, not onely lawfull things, but things proportionable to their power and ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>For as the Maſter muſt looke, that none of his ſeruants be idle, ſo he muſt ſee that none of them bee oppreſſed; if either of theſe things come to paſſe, that the Seruant bee ouerburdened, or idle, it is a fault in the Maſter, and hee dealeth not iuſtly with his Seruant. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, A righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, a iuſt dealing man, regardeth the life of his beaſt,<note place="margin">Prou. 12.10.</note> hee will not load his poore dumbe beaſt, with too heauie burdens, but hee regardeth the life and ſtrength of it: Much more ought a maſter to regard the life and ſtrength of his ſeruant, and accordingly to proportion out his buſineſſe and worke.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Maſters are of right to yeeld to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants prouiſion of meate, drinke, and cloathing, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent wages to prouide the ſame, and that they haue their meate, drinke, and wages in due ſeaſon; for that, the law of God, the law of nature, and the law of nations, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among all men; yea, among the very heathen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: and it is a iuſt thing, Seruants being men like to their Maſters in fleſh and blood, they muſt bee ſuſtained by earthly things, for their labours ſake, and therefore our Sauior ſaith, the workman is worthy of his meate (that is) of all neceſſaries for the maintenance of this life. In the deſcription of a good huſwife wee reade,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.10.</note> that ſhee riſeth whiles it is yet night, and giueth the portion to her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and the ordinarie to her maides; though ſhee raiſe vp her ſeruants betimes to worke,<note place="margin">Prou. 31.15.</note> yet ſhee is not cruell toward them, but giues them their foode in due ſeaſon. Shee feares not the ſnow for her family, for all her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is cloathed with Scarlet,<note place="margin">21.</note> or with double, &amp;c. ſhee prouides warme and thicke cloathes for her ſeruants that they may be defended againſt the extremity of cold.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, maſters are of right to yeeld to their ſeruants, iuſt cenſure and correction for their faults, they muſt not cenſure and correct them without iuſt cauſe, or exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely,
<pb n="1207" facs="tcp:490:621"/> but they muſt proportion out their admonitions, rebukes, and chaſtiſments, according to the offences of their ſeruants, and to that ende, they muſt wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature and qualitie of the offence, and of light, and ſmall offences, and little ouerſightes, not to tak notice. <hi>Giue not eare to all the words that men ſpeake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.23.</note> 
                     <hi>leſt thou heare thy ſeruant curſing thee.</hi> This reaſon is giuen of it. <hi>For often times thine heart knoweth that thou haſt curſed others:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note> thine owne heart can tell thee, thou haſt ſpoken as bad words againſt thy betters, and if the fault bee greater, deſeruing admonition, or rebuke, or correction, to meaſure it out according to the nature and qualitie of it; hee muſt alſo conſider, how often, or ſeldome, the Seruant hath fallen into that fault, and whether hee will bee bettered by word onely, or no, and if hee finde, that hee will not bee chaſtiſed with words alone, <hi>Though hee vnderſtand, yet will not anſwer,</hi> as it is <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 29.19. then to vſe further chaſtiſement.</p>
                  <p>And hee muſt euer take heede of paſſion in time of his cenſure, that he neither rebuke nor correct his ſeruant in rage and paſſion, for that will certainely carry him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond iuſt meaſure, but hee muſt doe it in compaſſion euen mourning in his heart for the ſinne of his ſeruant, with deſire to helpe him out of it.</p>
                  <p>And theſe three things ſpoken of are the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that Maſters are of right to yeelde to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond place, the ſpeciall things that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to yeeld to their Seruants in equity and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are theſe three.<note place="margin">There be 3. ſpeciall things that maſters are to yeeld to Seruants in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, moderate reſt from their labours, lawfull recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which ſeruants cannot continue with any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cheerefulneſſe in the duties of their callings; and hence it is often ſaid in the Lawe that thy ſeruant and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide may reſt as well as thou.<note place="margin">Exod. 23.12. Deut. 5.14.</note> Eſpecially Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="1248" facs="tcp:490:622"/> are bound in equity and eonſcience to giue their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants liberty to ſanctifie the Sabbath, and to keep an holy reſt to the Lord on his day, both publikely and priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for they being created and redeemed as well as their maſters, are as highly endebted to the ſeruice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God as their Maſters, this is plainely expreſſed in the fourth Commandement.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond ſpeciall thing that maſters are to yeeld to their Seruants in equitie and conſcience, is a ſupply of things needfull (according to their ability) in time of their ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſicknes, when the ſeruant is vnder the hand of God by ſickeneſſe, the maſter muſt prouide (as he is able) all good meanes that ſerue for his health and recouery, and that he may haue good vſage in time of his weakeneſſe, and not caſt him off at large, as the <hi>Amalakite</hi> did the poore <hi>Aegiptian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 30.13.</note> being ſicke in the field. And the Maſter may not defraude his ſeruant when he is ſicke, of things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, neither may he abridge him of any part of his wages, for the time of his ſickeneſſe; becauſe the ſeruant is not then reſtrained from working by his owne negligence, but by the hand of God, and it may bee, hath gotten his ſickeneſſe by his faithfull paines taking in his maſters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; and therefore his maſter in equitie is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him with things needefull, and to giue him his full wages agreed on betweene them at the firſt.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The laſt ſpeciall thinge that Maſters are to yeelde, to their ſeruants in conſcience, is, according to their power, ſome further recompence, ouer and aboue their wages, when they depart from them, according to the good and long ſeruice they haue done them.</p>

                  <p>Wee are to marke that the Apoſtle hauing ſaide in the chapter before, that ſeruantes truely beleeuing in Chriſt, and doeing their dutie to their Maſters, as they ought: in ſingleneſſe of heart; they ſhall receiue of the Lord, the reward of euerlaſtinge inheritance: the LORD doth eſteeme them as his ſons and heires, of his eternall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glorie, and will rewarde them as his ſonnes and heires.

                  <p>Come we to the ſecond generall thing laid down in this verſe (namely) the reaſon, the Apoſtle vſeth to perſwade all maſters, to yeeld to their ſeruants that which is juſt and

                  <p>We are heere firſt to marke and conſider the argument of the Apoſtle: he reaſons thus with Maſters, ye Maſters yeeld to your ſeruants that which is iuſt and equall, for you your ſelues are vnder another, you haue one as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter aboue you, who hath power and authoritie to call you to accompt for your dealings, and to puniſh you if you deale vniuſtly and vnconſcionably with your ſeruants, where wee ſee the Apoſtle perſwades maſters to doe their duetie to their ſeruants by an argument from their ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to an higher Lord and Maſter, who ſits aboue them as a Soueraigne Lord, hauing poure to call them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and to puniſh them for their neglect of dutie, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie abuſe of their authority, and they are to conſider it.</p>

                  <p>What? doeſt thou dreame of anie ſtrength in thy ſelfe, to beleeue or to doe the things thou haſt heard out of the word of God? Art thou ſo vnacquainted with the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>And for want of this, becauſe men doe not adde pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate praier to that which hath beene taught, and to which they haue beene exhorted, it comes to paſſe that the word is vnfruitfull and vnprofitable to them, though both generall and ſpeciall duties haue beene layd before them, and they haue beene ſtirred vppe to the practiſe of them, yet moſt men are ſtill in their ſinnes, and as vnreformed as euer they were, and heere is the cauſe of it, to teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtirring vppe to their duties, they neuer added prayer, they neuer humbly beſought the LORD, as hee had outwardly taught rhem their dueties by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, ſo hee would inwardly teach them by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and worke in them a conſcience of their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

                  <p>Yea, hence it is, that oft times the LORD doeth powre downe a curſe vppon men, and they are made woorſe by the holy thinges which they haue hearde and therefore learne we euer heereafter, to teaching and exhortation to adde prayer.</p>

                  <p>Now this doctrine might be applied to reproue ſundry ſorts of teachers,<note place="margin">Sundrie ſorts of teachers, briefly taxed.</note> as (namely) ſuch as deliuer the word of God in the intiſing words of mans wiſdome, ſpirituall things in a carnal manner.</p>

And as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.10. The wicked ſtumble, and fall in the waies of God; but that is offence taken, not giuen. True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, and profeſſors of the Goſpell muſt be wiſe in their behauiour, and take heede they giue not any iuſt cauſe of exception, or offence, and that not onely to their weake brethren, but euen to the wicked and vnbeleeuing. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle doth exhort vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17. To procure things honeſt in the ſight of all men (that is) wordes and deeds, not onely lawfull, and agreeable to the rule of honeſty, and goodnes, &amp; the will of God reuealed in his word, but ſuch alſo as giue no iuſt offence to any, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. Giue none offence, neither to the Iewes, nor to the Grecians, nor to the Church of God: neither to the Church, nor to thoſe that
<pb n="1288" facs="tcp:490:662"/> are without the Church, 1. Theſſ. 4.11.12. the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them of that Church, that they ſhould ſtudy to be quiet, and to meddle with their owne buſineſſe, and to worke with their owne hands; to this ende, that they might behaue themſelues honeſtly, (or as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth) decently towards them that are without, euen in the ſight of vnbeleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſee then there ought to be a Chriſtian wiſdome, a godly warineſſe, and circumſpection in ſuch as are true beleeuers, that in their behauiour among the wicked, they giue them no iuſt aduantage, either to except againſt, or to be offended with any thing, ſaid, or done by them.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of this duty is this.</p>
                  <p>The life and behauiour of true beleeuers, ought to bee a viſible confutation of the manners of the wicked, that when they looke vpon it, they may bee checked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, thereby made to ſee how they ought to behaue themſelues, and may glorifie God in the day of the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1.

                  <p>Oh remember thou haſt taken on thee the profeſſion

                  <p>We haue example of this in <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 19.10.

                  <p>And thus muſt thou that art a true profeſſour of the Goſpell doe ſometimes, and let it neuer bee iuſtly ſaid of thee, that wouldeſt carrie the name of a true Chriſtian,<note place="margin">3.

                  <p>

Oh then, thou that doſt, or wouldeſt carry the name of a true Chriſtian, bee thou carefull to walke wiſely toward them that are without, let thy words and deeds be ordered by Chriſtian wiſdome, in all thy ſpeaches, and actious, haue an eie to Gods glory, and the good of others, and take thou diligent heed, that nothing be ſaid, or done by thee, that may giue iuſt aduantage to the wicked to ſpeak euill of thee, and to throw diſgrace vpon thy holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, wee are to marke, that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>Walke wiſely with them, but toward them that are without;</hi> it is one thing to walke with vnbeleeuers, and

When it is good to the vſe of edifying, and doth miniſter grace to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
                  <p>Thus then we are to vnderſtand this exhortation.</p>

                  <p>Not to ſpeake of that which is offered to vs from this verſe, conſidered together with the former, the Apoſtle heere exhorting the Coloſſians to carrie themſelues wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie toward them that are without, particularly in regard of their ſpeach, and ſo implying that holy and gracious ſpeach ſerues much for the good of our ſelues, and others, we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake of that afterwards.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, we haue in this exhortation this duty plainely laid before vs.</p>
                  <q>That our ſpeach muſt bee gracious, it muſt <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And hence it is that the Preacher ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.12. That the words of the mouth of a wiſe man haue grace: and <hi>Prou.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, the tongue of the wiſe vſeth knowledge (that is) the wiſe perſon ſpeakes in ſuch ſort, as that his ſpeach doth ſhew foorth grace, and wee haue example of this in our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.22. Where wee finde it ſaid, that hee ſpake with an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and plaine demonſtration of grace, that the people wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of this, that our ſpeech muſt bee ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with grace, and ſauour of grace that is within, is plaine (namely) this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>I will ſpeake of them a little further in order briefly.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, our ſpeach muſt be ſeaſoned with a reuerent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God,<note place="margin">A reuerent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God and men.</note> if wee haue occaſion to vſe his names, and titles, as Lord, God, &amp;c. or thoſe things whereby hee is knowne to vs, as his attributes, his ordinances, his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, his iudgements, &amp;c. we are to vſe them with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of his great name, and with feare of his glorious maieſtie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58. and contrarie to this, is light and careleſſe vſing of any of his titles in our common talke and communication, cuſtomable ſwearing, and forſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, blaſpheming, curſing, making ieſts of Scripture phraſe, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Againe, our ſpeach muſt be ſeaſoned with a reuerent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of men, in our ſpeaking of men, and to men, we are to expreſſe a regard of that which is to bee reuerenced in them, as (namely) the image of God, and eſpecially the renouation of his image, and if they bee aboue vs in age,

Sam. 1.15. I might ſhewe this in other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                  <p>Contrarie to this, is ſcoffing, curſing &amp; deriding ſpeech, and vnreuerent ſpeaking of men, and to men. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, our ſpeech muſt be ſeaſoned with modeſty,<note place="margin">Modeſty.</note> and that is thus, if wee bee to mention good things, that are in vs, or good things done by vs, tending to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, we are to ſpeake of them with modeſtie, and ſo as wee rather extenuate them, then boaſt of them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1. Cor. 15.9. I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, which am not meete to bee called an Apoſtle, if wee bee to mention things that may mooue bluſhing, wee are to vtter them in as ſeemely wordes as poſſibly may bee.</p>
                  <p>Contrarie to this is boaſting and vainglorious ſpeaking of our ſelues forbidden, Prou. 27.2. let another man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth,<note place="margin">Meekeneſſe.</note> and contrary to modeſty in ſpeaking, is alſo filthie, obſcene and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte ſpeaking forbidden by the Apoſtle, chapter the 3. verſe 8. but put away euen all theſe things, wrath, anger, maliciouſneſſe, curſed ſpeaking, filthy ſpeaking out of your mouth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our ſpeech muſt be ſeaſoned with meekneſſe, we are to anſwer or reprooue thoſe that anie way offend vs, with meekeneſſe, with calme and quiet ſpeech, free from paſſion and perturbation, 1. Pet. 3.9. bee courteous (ſaith the Apoſtle) not rendering euill for euill, neither rebuke for rebuke.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this is miſcalling, rating and reuiling one another.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our ſpeech muſt be ſeaſoned with ſinceritie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> wee are to ſpeake the trueth ſincerely,<note place="margin">Sincerity.</note> or at leaſt that wee thinke to bee the trueth, and wee are to deale plainely,
<pb n="1308" facs="tcp:490:672"/> and ſincerely with others, in ſpeaking of their ſinnes, when iuſt occaſion is offred, to tell them of their ſins, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 4.25. ſpeake euerie man the truth vnto his neighbor Leuit. 19.17. thou ſhalt nor hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou ſhalt plainely rebuke thy neighbour, and ſuffer him not to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this, are lying, gloſing, diſſembling, and flattering ſpeeches, ſpeeches that ſooth vppe men in their ſinnes, or extell them aboue meaſure, whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeakes Pſal. 12.2. they ſpeake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour, flattering with their lips, and ſpeake with a double heart.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, our ſpeech muſt bee ſeaſoned with care of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mens good name,<note place="margin">Care of other mens good name.</note> wee are to ſpeake of the ſayings or doings of other men in priuate, charitably, either ſpeaking of them, as little as may bee, if they bee euill, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſing all in the better part, if they bee doubtfull, and where there is no euident cauſe to the contrary, which is an eſpeciall fruit of charity, as the Apoſtle ſhewes 1. Cor. 13.7. loue beleeueth all things, it hopeth all things, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth all things.</p>
                  <p>The contrary to this is raſh ſpeaking, and cenſuring of the ſayings and doings of others, ſlandering, ſecret whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring abroad the faults of another, tale-bearing, forbidden, Leuit. 19.16. Thou ſhalt not walke about with tales a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy people.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then how we are to conceiue the dutie propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded namely thus, our ſpeech muſt be ſeaſoned with grace, and it muſt ſauour of grace, (that is) it muſt expreſſe a reuerent regard both of God and man, it muſt be a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of our modeſtie, meeknes, ſincerity, &amp; a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the good name of others. <label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">Reproofe of ſuch perſons as many waies vtter foorth vnſauoury ſpeeches.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then if wee examine our ſelues touching this duetie, how farr will manie of vs bee found from that grace that ought to be in our ſpeeches? are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="1309" facs="tcp:490:672"/> that are ſo far from ſeaſoning of their ſpeech with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent regard of the great names of the LORD as that they careleſly vſe them in their common talke, and vpon euerie trifling occaſion vſe to ſay, O LORD, O GOD Ieſus &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And is the number of thoſe few, that powder their ſpeech not with grace, but with oathes, blaſphemies, and curſings? I wiſh it were not ſo, but alaſſe, the number of ſuch is exceeding great, manie there bee that ſcarſe ſpeak a word, but they powder it with an oath, yea, little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo ſoone as they are able to ſpeake, their mouthes are full of oathes, they learne them (no doubt) of their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and this is ſo common a ſinne, as wee may iuſtly ſay as the Prophet did, Ierem. 23.10. becauſe of oathes the land mourneth; and are there not manie whoſe mouthes are full of ſcoffing, ſcorning, and reproachfull ſpeeches? and as for ſeaſoning our ſpeech with modeſtie, meekneſſe, ſincerity, and due regard of others good name, are there not many whoſe mouthes runne ouer with ribald and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſpeaking, with railing, reuiling, with lying, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, flattering, with vncharitable cenſuring, with ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſecret whiſpering, with tale-bearing? as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 1. Timoth. 5.13. ſome goe about from houſe to houſe, and are pratlers, and clacke in euerie corner, whatſoeuer they know, and ſo are ſowers of diſſention, and makers of ſtrife.</p>
                  <p>Well, let vs take notice of our ſinne, and know who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art, that art guiltie of ſinne in anie of theſe kindes, thou art ſo farre from gracious ſpeech, as that thy ſpeech is graceleſſe and wicked.</p>
                  <p>And as they that haue their ſpeech powdered with grace haue teſtimonie to their comfort, that their hearts are ſeaſoned with the ſpirit of grace;<note place="margin">Foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to ſtir vs vp to haue our ſpeech ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grace.</note> ſo thou haſt euidence and teſtimonie to thy terrour, that the Diuell ſits and rules in thy heart, and that thy tongue is ſet on fire of hell, Iam. 3.6. Conſider therefore thy fearefull condition, and
<pb n="1310" facs="tcp:490:673"/> the greatneſſe of thy ſinne, and nowe therefore whileſt that thou haſt time bee thou humbled for it, and labour henceforward to haue thy ſpeech ſeaſoned with grace, and ſauouring of grace; and to that end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with mee further what Salomon ſaith, Prou. 20.15. there is golde and a multitude of precious ſtones, but the lippes of knowledg are a precious iewell, as if hee had ſayd, the greateſt heape of golde and precious ſtones, is not to be compared with gracious words, and ſpeech ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with grace.</p>
                  <p>And againe:</p>
                  <p>Prouerbs 13.2. a man ſhall eate good thinges by the fruite of his mouth, what bee thoſe good thinges that a man ſhall eate, as the fruite of his gracious ſpeech? ſurely, the good will of good men: yea, as Salomon ſaith, Prou. 22.11. of great men, and Gods bleſſing, theſe two are the precious fruites which good and gracious ſpeeches bring foorth, as on the contrarie, ſpeech wanting grace, is like ſtinking fleſh, and it is loathſome and odious to God and good men, if therefore thou wouldeſt haue teſtimony to thy comfort, that thy heart is ſeaſoned with grace, if thou wouldeſt bee enriched with that which is better then golde, or precious ſtones, if thou wouldeſt not vtter that which is hatefull to God, and loathſome to all good men, and if thou deſire the good will of men, and Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on thee, then bee thou carefull to haue thy ſpeech ſeaſoned with grace, neuer reſt till thou finde that thy ſpeech is the verie image and liuely picture of grace, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in it and expreſſing a reuerent regard of God and men, modeſtie, meekeneſſe, ſinceritie and a due regarde of the good name of others.</p>
                  <p>From this exhortation, let your ſpeech be gracious and powdered with ſalt.</p>

                  <p>And heere it ſignifies generally to begin and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſpeech, wee finde the word <hi>(anſwer)</hi> ſo vſed in manie places of Scripture, Matth. 11.25. it is ſaid, at that time Ieſus anſwered &amp;c. wee finde in that place, no queſtion nor demand going before, and ſo the word (anſwered) hath not there reſpect to anie queſtion or demand fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going

                  <p>Now becauſe an anſwer (as wee know) is commonly occaſioned by a queſtion, or demaund from ſome other man; and is, or ought to be fitte, and ſutable to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or demaund, and made according to the purpoſe, and meaning of him that makes the queſtion, or demaund: Therefore the Apoſtle addes (euery man) his meaning is, fitly, and to good purpoſe, according to the occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from any man.

                  <p>Wee are to marke and obſerue in the firſt place, that the Apoſtle did heere exhort the Coloſſians, that they ſhould haue gracious ſpeech in their mouthes; that their ſpeech ſhould bee euer ſeaſoned with grace, to this end: that they might knowe both what, and howe to ſpeake fitly and to good purpoſe, vpon euery occaſion.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle hauing finiſhed the firſt generall part of this Chapter (namely) his exhortation to ſome generall duties.</p>
                  <p>In this ſeuenth verſe he enters on the ſecond generall part of it, containing the concluſion of his whole Epiſtle,<note place="margin">The ſecond generall part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the concluſion of this whole Epiſtle.</note> the particular parts and branches of his concluſion wee haue heeretofore laid foorth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is laid downe in the 7.8. and 9. verſe and is a declaration of the Apoſtles owne loue, and care of the Coloſſians, expreſſed by ſending certaine meſſengers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to acquaint them with his eſtate, and generally with the eſtate of the Church where he was, and alſo to vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand their eſtate, and to comfort, and confirme their hearts; that is the ſome and ſubſtance of theſe three verſes.</p>
                  <p>In them, we haue more particularly theſe two things offered to our conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the perſons whom the Apoſtle ſent, and emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in his meſſage.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ends and cauſes wherefore he ſent them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>The perſons he ſent, were <hi>Tychichus,</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and both theſe he deſcribes, and commendes to the Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="1322" facs="tcp:490:679"/> to be worthy perſons, by certaine excellent quallities. As firſt, in the 7. verſe, hee commends <hi>Tychicus</hi> both by that which was common to him with all true beleeuing Chriſtians, that hee was a brother, to which hee addes the adiunct and epithite <hi>(beloued) (Tychicus our beloued bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi> and then by that which was more proper, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, in reſpect of his calling and function, as that he was,
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, a Miniſter,</item>
                        <item>Secondly, more ſpecially, a fellow-ſeruant with the Apoſtle in the Lords buſineſſe.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to both theſe, he addes the adiunct <hi>(faithfull) and faithfull Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he likewiſe commends <hi>Oneſimus</hi> verſe 9.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the title <hi>(brother)</hi> to which hee ioines two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithites <hi>(faithfull, and beloued) With Oneſimus a faithfull and beloued brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, by the particular relation that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Oneſimus</hi> and the Coloſſians, that hee was one of them.</p>
                  <p>Now the endes and cauſes wherefore the Apoſtle ſends theſe two worthy perſons to the Coloſſians, are two.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, to let them vnderſtand, both his ſtate particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, verſe 7. <hi>(ſhall declare vnto you my whole ſtate)</hi> and the things done where he was, generally, verſe 9. <hi>(They ſhall ſhew you of all things heere.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ſecondly, that by them the Apoſtle might bee certified of the eſtate of the Coloſſians, and they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by thoſe hee ſent vnto them, chieflie by <hi>Tychicus,</hi> a faithfull Miniſter; therefore he ſaith, verſe 8. <hi>Whom I haue ſent vnto you for the ſame purpoſe, that he might know your ſtate and comfort your hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we haue the reſolution of theſe three verſes. I take them together, becauſe they make but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
                  <p>In further handling of them, I will firſt ſpeake of the
<pb n="1337" facs="tcp:490:679"/> perſons that were ſent, and then of the ends, and cauſes of their ſending.</p>
                  <p>And fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the perſons before we come to ſpeake of them ſeueraly we may obſerue thus much in generall.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſent not one meſſenger alone, but two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though <hi>Tychicus</hi> was a worthy meſſenger, and fit for the diſpatch of the buſineſſe alone, yet with him hee ſent <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> no doubt in theſe reſpects, both to make the meſſage of more authority, the things that concerned eyther party being confirmed by the teſtimony of two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and for the mutuall comfort and aid which they might haue of each other, both in their journey, and in their buſineſſe there, and for theſe cauſes (no doubt) it was, that our Sauiour ſent out his twelue Apoſtles two by two Mark. 6.7. and ſo the 70. diſciples, two and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Luke 10.1. Hence we may gather the wiſedome and care that ought to bee vſed in matters and buſineſſes of waight and importance, eſpecially in buſineſſes of the Church, both in regard of the buſines it ſelfe, and of the perſons imployed in the ſame, but on that I will not ſtand, onely obſerue we generally touching the perſons ſent by the Apoſtle thus much.</p>
                  <p>That the Apoſtle did commend the perſons whom hee ſent on his meſſage, &amp; he ſet them out by ſundry excellent qualities, and titles of honor, he ſaid not barely, I haue ſent to you one named <hi>Tychicus,</hi> &amp; an other whoſe name is <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi> but I haue ſent to you <hi>Tichicus,</hi> a man excellently qualified, a <hi>b loued brother</hi> and faithfull miniſter with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſimus</hi> alſo a man worthy commendation, beeing a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd a beloued brother, who is one of you: as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaide, I haue ſent vnto you, men whom you may ſafely credit and beleeue, and the report and meſſage they bring you, is to bee regarded, becauſe I know they are good men, and I dare boldly commend them to you for ſuch as wil ſpeake the trueth, and make conſcience of that they deliuer vnto you.</p>
                  <pb n="1324" facs="tcp:490:680"/>
                  <p>This no doubt was the Apoſtles drift and purpoſe, in commending his meſſengers ſent to the Coloſſians, whence we may gather thus much.</p>
                  <p>That the dignitie and goodneſſe of the perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons bee it one or more, that are ſent on a meſſage of weight and importance, is of great force to giue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the meſſage that is brought, when the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger is knowne to be an honeſt man, and of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and one fearing God, the meſſage that he brings, is the better credited, the honeſtie, fidelitie and good qualities of the meſſenger commonly makes the meſſage more welcome and better regarded.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Dauid</hi> concluded of <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zadoke,</hi>

We read <hi>Mark:</hi> 6.20. <hi>Herod</hi> did many things that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> taught, not becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> was an excellent teacher, but becauſe he was a good man, ſo
<pb n="1325" facs="tcp:490:680"/> ſaith the text, <hi>Herod</hi> knowing that <hi>Iohn</hi> was a iuſt man and holy, he reuerenced him, he did manie thinges, and heard him gladly.</p>
                  <p>Now heere occaſion is giuen to reprooue ſome, who <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Wee for our parts are to pray for this, that ſeeing the <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Come now we to ſpeak of the perſons ſeuerally, &amp; firſt of <hi>Tychicus</hi> &amp; his commendation, in theſe words <hi>(Tychicus our beloued brother, and faithfull miniſter, and fellow-ſeruant in the Lord)</hi> what <hi>Tychicus</hi> was by birth, in reſpect of the country, we find Act. 20.4. that he was borne in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that hee went with <hi>Paul</hi> going thither to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but for his deſcription, heere <hi>Paul</hi> cals him.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, he cals him <hi>(faithfull Minister)</hi> that is, one who did ſerue Chriſt in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and preaching of the Goſpell, and in that office, he did anſwer that truſt that was repoſed in him.</p>
                  </q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Tychicus</hi> who is one profeſſing the ſame true faith with vs, one (no doubt) beloued of God, and one whom I loue, and worthy to bee beloued of all true Chriſtians, and one that doth faithfully ſerue Chriſt, in the miniſtry and preaching of his Goſpell, yea, and labours together with mee, in the miniſtrie of the word, he ſhall declare vnto you my whole ſtate.</q>
                  <p>Note we heere, in the firſt place, that the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending <hi>Tychicus,</hi> he giues him theſe titles, as titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignitie, that hee was a beloued brother, and faithfull Miniſter, and fellow-ſeruant in the Lord, hee
<pb n="1327" facs="tcp:490:681"/> thought hee could not better grace him, and ſet him out, then by theſe titles, a brother in Chriſt, a Miniſter of the goſpell, and a fellow-ſeruant in the Lord; hence then it is cleare.</p>
                  <p>That theſe are indeed ſtiles and titles of great honour, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. We finde, that when a certaine woman that had beene a notorious ſinner came to Chriſt, ſitting in the Phariſies houſe, though ſhe waſhed his feet with teares and ſhewed forth token of vnfained repentance, and loue, yet the Phariſie that had bidden Chriſt, ſtill eſteemed of the woman as ſhee had beene in times paſt, and ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe, verſe 39 Surely, this man is not a Prophet, if he were, hee would haue knowne who, and what manner of woman this is which toucheth him, for ſhee is a ſinner: this ſecret thought and cloſe biting cenſure of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, our Sauiour, who knew his heart, brought to light, and he reproued it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by propounding to him a Parable, from the 40. verſe to the 47. and in the 47. verſe, he doth directly check his hard conceit of the woman, and telles him, that hee thought amiſſe of her: I ſay to thee, many ſins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her for ſhe loued much, as if he had ſaid, thou iudgeſt amiſſe of this woman, thou art not to deeme of her accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her former life paſt, knowne to thee to be wicked, and ſinnefull, but as ſhee now is, truly penitent, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe an humble penitentiarie, iudge of her by her loue, which is an infallible proofe of her acquittance, and diſcharge from her ſinnes, plainely teaching the point I haue now propounded, that we are not to think, or eſteem the worſe of any one, that hath beene knowne in former times to be faulty, if ſo be now we ſee viſible and apparant ſignes of his vnfained repentance, but we are to thinke and ſpeake of him as now he is.</p>

                  <p>And the reaſons of this are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of God that hee may bee glorified in the conuerſion of ſinners, for the worſe they haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the greater is Gods mercy and power in their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his mercy towards them therein ought the more to be acknowledged, and he the more magnified for the ſame accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in reſpect of the perſon himſelfe that hath repented, that he may be encouraged, and fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the good eſtimation hee is in with men, for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer his conſcience, after his true repentance, doe aſſure him of Gods fauour towards him, yet his weakeneſſe will eaſily make him ſuſpect, that hee is contemned of men, or that howſoeuer they make ſhew of eſteeming him, yet ſome hard conceit ſtill ſtickes in their minde againſt him.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, in regard of other men, to whom his labours and endeauours, though neuer ſo well performed, ſhall be of little force or fruit, except their bee a good opinion conceiued of him, for theſe reaſons wee are not to thinke, or ſpeake the worſe of any that hath beene heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowne to bee guilty of ſome great ſinne, if now hee haue repented, and doe ſhew euident ſignes of ſound repentance. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And where hee ſaith verſe 8. that he ſent to them for the ſame purpoſe, that he might know their ſtate, his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that he might vnderſtand the ſtate of their church and how it ſtood with them in regard of Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, how the Goſpell proſpered, and was glorified among them, or otherwiſe how they were moleſted, and troubled for the Goſpell, heads (and might comfort your hearts) (that is) might encourage you, and cheere vp your harts, happily grieuing, and fainting for my impriſonment, or perſecution of the Church, that he might hearten, and ſtrengthen you againſt imminent dangers, and againſt the ſcandall, and offence of the croſſe; thus then we are to conceiue the Apoſtles meaning, in reſpect of the ends wherefore he ſent meſſengers to Coloſſe, as if he had ſaid.</p>

                  <p>And hence is the doctrine of the Goſpell called the power of God, 1. Cor. 1.18. and verſe 24. the power of God, and the wiſedome of God, yea, hence it was that our Sauiour ſayd, Iohn 5.25. that the houre ſhould come, and then was, that the dead ſhould heare the voice of the ſon of God, and ſhould liue. The Lord doth rule and worke ſo powerfully by the doctrine of his word and goſpell, as that thereby he quickeneth, and giueth life to the dead, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſuch as are dead in their ſinnes, and makes them liue a new ſpirituall life, and yeeld obedience and ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, and therfore by that doth he rule and raigne amongſt vs, and ouer vs, in ſpeciall manner, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is this.</p>
                  <p>The word and goſpell, is one of the lawes of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, and hence is the word, the doctrine of the goſpell, called the word of the kingdome, Mat. 13.19. and the law of faith, Rom. 3.27. where is then the reioycing (ſayth the Apoſtle) it is excluded, by what law? of works? nay, but by the law of faith, by the doctrin of the goſpell.</p>

                  <p>Now as an earthly King doth rule and raigne ouer his ſubiects, and keepes them in awe and order, in ſpeciall manner by the lawes of his Kingdome, ſo doth the Lord by his word and Goſpell, and of the Lawes of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, and therefore by that doth he in ſpeciall manner rule and raigne amongſt vs, and exerciſe his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power ouer his Church and children, hence then it muſt needes follow, that the more or leſſe the doctrine of the word and Goſpell, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The Apoſtle in this 12. and 13. verſes ſtill goes on in the ſecond branch of his concluſion, namely, the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the loue of others that were with him towardes the Coloſſians, and heere he ſets downe, the loue of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras</hi>
                     <pb n="1380" facs="tcp:490:709"/> towards them, manifeſted, and made knowne by two things.</p>
                  <q>By his ſalutations ſent to them, and by his praiers for them.</q>
                  <p>That hee ſaluted them, and that he praied for them, Now theſe things are not thus naked, and barely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but firſt the Apoſtle deſcribes <hi>Epaphras,</hi> by two qualities or conditions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by his calling, that he was the ſeruant of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by that particular relation that was betweene him and the Coloſſians, that he was one of them, <hi>Epaphras the ſeruant of Chriſt which is one of you ſaluteth you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then the Apoſtle further ſets out <hi>Epaphras</hi> by his praying for the Coloſſians.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the manner of his <hi>praying,</hi> that it was with ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings and earneſt contention, and that continually, in theſe words, <hi>(and alwaies ſtriueth for you in praiers).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly by the matter of his praier, what it was hee praied for, on their behalfe, namely this, that they might ſtand perfect, and full in all the will of God.</p>
                  <p>And then verſe 13. the Apoſtle doth diſcouer the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of that earneſt ſtriuing of <hi>Epaphras</hi> in praier, for the Coloſſians, that it proceeded from his zeale for them, which zeale of his is further ſet out by the meaſure, that it was great: and by the extent of it, in regard of the perſons to whom it reached, that it reached not onely to the Coloſſians, but alſo to them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis: and it is alſo confirmed by the teſtimonie of the Apoſtle, <hi>I beare him record he hath a great zeale for you, &amp;c.</hi> in which teſtimonie is alſo preuented a ſecret obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for happily the Coloſſians might haue ſaid to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect:</hi> How know you that <hi>Epaphras</hi> ſtriueth in prayer for vs, are you priuie to his priuate prayers, for therein eſpecially, if hee doe remember vs, hee makes mention of vs?</p>
                  <pb n="1381" facs="tcp:490:709"/>
                  <p>Now this obiection the Apoſtle preuents when he ſaith, <hi>(for I beare him record that he hath a great zeale for you, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſaid, howſoeuer I am not priuy to his priuate prayers, yet I dare boldly write, that he ſtriueth for you in prayer, becauſe I am priuie to, and a witneſſe of a great zeale that he beares to you, and to them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. And thus we ſee the generall things that are laid downe in theſe two verſes.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to ſpeake of them, as they lye in order, and I will take the words as they are layd downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs.</p>

Where hee ſaith, <hi>I ceaſe not to pray for you, and to deſire, that yee might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will in all wiſdome and ſpirituall vnderſtanding.</hi> By theſe two places compared together, wee may eaſily conceiue whereunto theſe words <hi>(perfect and full)</hi> haue relation, namely, to the knowledge, and obedience to the will of God, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, perfect and full in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and obedience to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeuerally, that word <hi>(perfect)</hi> doth not heere ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie abſolutely perfect, in knowledge and obedience to Gods will perfect, with a perfection of knowledge and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, in meaſure and degree which cannot be reached in this life, but ſoundly perfect, with perfection of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and truth oppoſed to hypocriticall holineſſe, and emptineſſe, and ſo the word <hi>(perfect)</hi> is often vſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Hezekia</hi> ſaid, hee had walked before the Lord in truth, and with a perfect heart: he puts theſe two together, and therefore the Apoſtle heere addes the word <hi>(full)</hi> giuing vs to vnderſtand, that he meant ſuch a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as is oppoſed to emptineſſe, and hollowneſſe.

                  <p>This then is briefely the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this verſe.</p>
                  <q>For I witneſſe with <hi>Epaphras,</hi> that he hath a burning loue, euen a loue that often times, like fire flames out, and ſhewes it ſelfe, both towards you, and towards your neighbors, them of Laodicea, and them of Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis.</q>

                  <pb n="1400" facs="tcp:490:719"/>
                  <p>And for further proofe of this, the example of Paul, is moſt pregnant: he, in many of his Epiſtles, makes knowne his zeale, and his feruent loue towards thoſe, to whome he wrote.</p>
                  <p>And therevpon, his carefull performance of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, iſhuing out from thence, euen his carefull inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, admoniſhing, reproouing, comforting, and praying for them, as occaſion was offered. 2. Cor. 7.3. Hee ſaith the Corinthians were in his heart, to dye and liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and from that loue of his, it was that hee made them ſorry with a letter, verſe 8. and hee ſaith, verſe 12. That hee wrote that letter vnto them, to manifeſt, and make knowne his care towards them, in the ſight of God. From his loue, and from his care towards them, came his carefull reproofe, of that which was amiſſe in them by his letter. 1. Theſſ. in the 2. and 3. chapter, hee doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably cleare the truth of this poynt, in his owne example. Chap. 2. he ſaith, he was affected towards the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as a Nurſe, and as a Father to his children: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus affectioned (ſaith he) verſe 8. Our good will was to haue dealt vnto you, not the Goſpel of God onely, but alſo our owne ſoules, becauſe ye weare deere vnto vs. And then verſe 11. that from that loue it was, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, and comforted them, and beſought euerie one of them, as a father his children. And chapter 3.1. he ſaith, wherefore ſince wee could no longer forbeare, as if hee had ſaide, my loue towardes you was ſuch, and ſo ſtrong within me, it was like a fire in my breaſt, I could no longer keepe it in, and from thence it was, that I ſent <hi>Tymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> our brother to eſtabliſh, and to comfort you touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your faith, a plaine euidence and proofe of this.</p>
                  <p>That out of zeale and burning loue towards others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer comes a carefull performance of all good duties, and the reaſon of this is very plaine, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And therefore certainely, out of zeale, and burninge loue, euer comes carefull performance of euery good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence then wee may eaſilie conceiue, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>They haue not onely that grace of true loue to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren begun in them, but they many times feele it feruent, and hot within them.</p>
                  <p>Now then, this being ſo, that the children of God, many <label type="milestone">

This

                  <p>One thing further wee are to marke, the Apoſtle doth not barely affirme it, that <hi>Epaphras</hi> had a great zeale to the Coloſſians, &amp;c. but he confirmes it by his own teſtimonie: and to the end they might be fully perſwaded of it, hee ſaith, <hi>I beare him record,</hi> or <hi>witneſſe, that he hath a great zeale

                  <p>That we are to witneſſe the good things, and the good <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Thus did the Apoſtle in this place; and thus did our Sauiour giue teſtimonie to <hi>Iohn,</hi> Mat: 11.11. <hi>Verily I ſay vnto you, among them which are begotten of women, aroſe there not a greater then Iohn Baptist:</hi> thus are we to doe, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring this rule.</p>

                  <p>Who this <hi>Luke</hi> was, it is doubtfull, and ſome thinke it was <hi>Luke</hi> the Euangeliſt that writ the goſpell, and the Acts of the Apoſtles; others thinke it was not he, but ſome other man of that name,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> to which opinion I rather incline, becauſe in all likelyhood, if it had been <hi>Luke</hi> the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, the Apoſtle would rather haue giuen him that title, then the title of Phyſitian, that being a more excellent ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and of greater honour and dignitie.

                  <p>That according to the example of <hi>Luke</hi> we are to carry our ſelues in our perſonal and particular calling as we may iuſtly gaine loue from thoſe, with whom we haue to deale, that we may iuſtly and truely bee called <hi>(being Phyſicians)</hi> beloued Phyſicians, being Marchants, beloued Marchants and ſuch like, and that wee may ſo doe, wee muſt looke

And if wee ſo doe, wee ſhall (doubtleſſe) winne the loue of our brethren, and finde comfort in our owne hearts.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place obſerue we, that the Apoſtle concludes with <hi>Demas,</hi> that he alſo ſent ſalutations to the Coloſſians, and hee onely names him, and ſets no marke of honour vpon him; And whence was this? Surely the holy Ghoſt whoſe pen-man the Apoſtle was, ſeeing the hollowneſſe and hypocriſie of <hi>Demas,</hi> which afterwards brake out, and appeared in forſaking <hi>Paul,</hi> and imbracing this preſent world, would not vouchſafe him any title of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though hee deceiued men, who made account of him in regard of the good profeſſion he made for a time, and he was a companion to the Apoſtle, yet hee could not deceiue the holy Ghoſt, he ſaw his hollow heart and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would not giue him any title of honour, more then this, that hee ſent ſalutations to the Coloſſians, which a wretched worldling may eaſily doe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>(brethren)</hi> in Scripture hath diuers accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ſometimes it ſignifies ſuch as are children of the ſame wombe, brethren by nature, as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were; ſome times men of the ſame bloud, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot, Geneſ.</hi> 13.8. ſometimes men of the ſame Countrey, thus <hi>Sauls</hi> countrey-men are called his brethren, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 12.2, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men of the ſame religion.

                  <p>Thus then are the words of this verſe to bee conceiued, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
                  <q>Salute in my name, or from me your neighbours, thoſe at Laodicea, who being conuerted to the faith of the Goſpell make open profeſſion of the ſame, and more ſpecially Nymphas, and his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian family, which for the pietie and good order obſerued in the ſame, in the vſe of holy exerciſes, is, euen as a little viſible Church, or congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which there be profeſſors of true religion, worſhipping God according to his word in the exerciſes of religion.</q>

                  <p>A third opinion is, that the Epiſtle here ſpoken of written from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> was an Epiſtle written to the Apoſtle, either from the whole Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> or from the Paſtor of that Church; and (indeed) this opinion is moſt probable and moſt agreeable to the words of the Text, without any addition or forcing at all, and it ſeemes, that Epiſtle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> was written to <hi>Paul</hi> touching ſome
<pb n="1428" facs="tcp:490:733"/> things to which he makes anſwer in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,</hi> and therefore he willed the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to reade it, that they might the better vnderſtand vpon what occaſion he had written ſomethings contained in this Epiſtle to them: and ſo taking that to be the meaning, that the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle written from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> was an Epiſtle, that either that whole Church, or the Paſtor of that Church had written to <hi>Paul.</hi>

                  <p>Againe the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2.3.

                  <p>If then thou doſt deſire that the word heard, or read by thee, may be truly profitable: that the inſtructions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and threatnings of it, may be to thy good, and if thou wouldſt not both ſtrip thy ſelfe of the benefit of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and comforts of it, and finde the threatnings of it made good vpon thy ſelfe, then learne thou whenſoeuer thou doſt either heare, or read it, to thinke, and be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the matter of it belongs to thee in particular, and that thou art to make vſe of it according to the purpoſe and drift of it.</p>
                  <p>To omit that which the Papiſts gather from the laſt words of this verſe, that ſeeing the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> is not to bee found, therefore ſome part of the Scripture is loſt, and that the canonicall Scripture wee haue, is not ſufficient without addition of vnwritten tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that being built but vpon their owne miſ-interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the text: the Apoſtle willed the Coloſſians to read the Epiſtle written from Laodicea, no doubt, that they might better vnderſtand ſome things in this Epiſtle, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to themſelues.

                  <p>In this Verſe, wee haue another thing laid before vs, which the Apoſtle willed the Coloſſians to doe, (namely this) that they ſhould ſpeake to <hi>Archippus,</hi> and hee tells them what he ſhould ſay to him, what words they ſhould vſe, and after what manner they ſhould ſpeake to him; as that they ſhould ſpeake by way of admonition, and warne him to take heed to the miniſterie hee had receiued in the Lord, <hi>(And ſay to Archippus take heed to the miniſterie that thou haſt receiued in the Lord.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this warning or admonition we haue more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly theſe things to be conſidered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Firſt the matter of the admonition, in theſe words, <hi>take heed to the miniſterie that thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the Lord.</hi>

                     <item>2 Then the extent of that duty, how farre forth <hi>Archippus</hi> ſhould take heed and looke to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, (namely) ſo far as that he ſhould fulfill it, <hi>Take heed to the miniſterie that thou haſt receiued in the Lord that thou fulfill it.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 And thirdly, in the words of this admonition, the Apoſtle layes downe a ſtrong and effectuall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="1437" facs="tcp:490:737"/> to perſwade <hi>Archippus</hi> to take heed to his miniſterie, taken from the author of his miniſtery, that hee had that his miniſterie from the Lord, that he had receiued it by his grace, and therefore he ſhould looke to it, and fulfill it; <hi>Take heed to the miniſterie that thou haſt received in the Lord that thou fulfill it.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And the occaſion of this warning to be giuen by the Coloſſians to <hi>Archippus</hi> in all likelihood and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie, was this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Archippus</hi> was a miniſter in the Church of Coloſſe, and was a colleague, and fellow-helper in that Church to <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras,</hi> who was then at Rome with <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore hee ought in the abſence of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> to haue been diligent in his miniſterie, which it ſeemes he was not, and therefore the Apoſtle would haue him admoniſhed, and put in minde of his duty.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore briefely lay forth the ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this verſe. <hi>(And ſay to Archippus,)</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and warne <hi>Archippus,</hi> on this manner, <hi>(take heed to the miniſtery,)</hi> the originall is (ſee to the miniſtery,) the meaning is, carefully looke to the office and function, diligently weigh and conſider, what it is, the weight of it, and what belongs to that paſtorall duty, <hi>(that thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the Lord)</hi> that is, that thou haſt receiued from the Lord, which he of his grace and mercy, hath committed vnto thee, <hi>(that thou fulfill it.)</hi> The word <hi>fulfill,</hi> is meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically borrowed and taken from a veſſell, that ought to be full of liquor, or the like matter, and is not; and the Apoſtle compares the miniſterie of <hi>Archippus</hi> to ſuch a veſſell, which had ſomewhat put into it, but was not filled to the brim, as it ſhould haue been: and ſo when hee ſaith <hi>that thou fulfill it,</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid, that thou fill vp that veſſell of thy miniſterie, as it ought to be filled, and leaue no empty place in it: and his meaning is, that thou do it not to the halfes, or in ſome part, and leaue it
<pb n="1438" facs="tcp:490:738"/> vndone in another, but that thou performe it, in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as it ought to be performed, that thou accompliſh and performe all the parts of that office and miniſterie; Thus then briefly conceiue the Apoſtles meaning.</p>
                  <q>Admoniſh Archippus on this manner; Looke carefully, and diligently conſider with thy ſelfe, what is that office and function, the weight of it, and what belongs to that paſtorall duty, which thou hast receiued from the Lord, and which he of his grace and mercy hath committed to thee, that thou performe it in euery reſpect, as it ought to be performed, that thou leaue nothing vndone in that office that ought to be done, but that thou accompliſh it in all the parts of it.</q>
                  <p>Now firſt, it is not to be paſſed by without obſeruation, that howſoeuer the Apoſtle in the verſe before inioyned the reading of his Epiſtle, that it ſhould be read both in the Church of Coloſſe and of Laodicea, yet heere he addes <hi>Archippus</hi> ſhould be put in minde of his duty, that hee ſhould be admoniſhed to looke to the fulfilling of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, that he ſhould be ſtirred vp to a diligent teaching of the word amongſt the Coloſſians. Hence wee may gather.</p>

No, no, there is no likelyhood in it, and therefore it is but a vaine excuſe to ſay they haue the Bible at home, they can, and do read in the Bible: this is but a fond ſhift; and we muſt know it is not enough for vs to read in the Bible, (though

It is ſaid that
<pb n="1443" facs="tcp:490:740"/> ſome of the people went out on the ſeuenth day to gather <hi>Manna,</hi> but found none, whereupon it is ſaid, verſe 28. that the Lord reproued <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſaid vnto him, <hi>How long refuſe yee to keepe my Commandements and my Lawes?</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> had not prophaned the Sabbath, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not all, but ſome of the people, yet the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued <hi>Moſes</hi> becauſe the people that were vnder his charge had ſinned: ſo waighty a burden lies on thoſe that haue any way the ouerſight of others, that they muſt giue account in regard of their ſinnes, if they offend through their default, and neglect of duty; and thus ought ſuch as haue any office or function publike or priuate, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to waigh and conſider with themſelues, what that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is, what belongs, vnto the waight of it. Thus no doubt, did <hi>Salomon</hi> when he made that praier to the Lord, 1 King. 3.9. <hi>Giue to thy ſeruant an vnderſtanding heart, that I may diſcerne betweene good and bad:</hi> and hee doth expreſſe as much in the laſt words of the verſe, <hi>For who is able to iudge this thy mighty people,</hi> as if he ſaid, I conſider the waight of mine office, and I finde it great and waightie; therefore Oh Lord I beſeech thee ſtrengthen me, and enable mee to doe my dutic; and to this purpoſe (no doubt) was that wholeſome admonition of <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> to his Iudges, 2.

As if hee had ſaid, diligently conſider with your ſelues, what offiice you are called to, what is the charge that lies vpon you, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to your office, you execute not the iudgements of man, but of the Lord, and hee will bee with you in the cauſe and iudgement.

Well know thou whoſoeuer thou art, thou art to take heede and to ſee to thine office, and to conſider ſeriouſly what it is, what belongs vnto it, and the waight of it. And that thou maieſt ſo doe, learne thy dutie what belongs to thine office and calling out of the word of God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19. the King is enioined to reade the word of God, all the daies of his life, that thence he may learne his duty and in the word of God the Lord hath laide downe, the offices and duties of all ſorts of callings, of Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Maſters, particularly, to that end (without queſtion) that they ſhould learne, know, and conſider them; doe thou therefore thence learne the things that concerne thine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and knowing thoſe things, conſider them, and haue an eie to them at all times.</p>

                  <p>In this Verſe we haue the cloſing or ſhutting vp of this Epiſtle,<note place="margin">The ſhutting vp of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</note> and the Apoſtle ſhuts it vp both with his owne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation to the Coloſſians, and that not written by the hand of his Secretarie (as the other were) but with his own hand, <hi>The ſalutation by the hand of me Paul.</hi> and with his prayer to God for them, that the grace of God might bee with them, <hi>(Grace be with you)</hi> to which is added the vſuall word commonly ſubioyned to petitions made to the Lord <hi>(Amen.)</hi> and between theſe two, between the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſalutation and prayer, is inſerted and interlaced a ſhort precept, that they ſhould be mindfull of him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his bands. I will firſt cleare the words of this verſe, touching the ſenſe and meaning of them; <hi>The ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by the hand of me Paul:</hi>

<pb n="1455" facs="tcp:490:746"/> in praying for him, and in making vſe of his ſufferings for the goſpell to themſelues, that they ſhould both commend him to God in their prayers, and pray to the Lord to giue him patience, ſtrength, and conſtancie in his troubles, to ſtand faſt in defence of the goſpell, and to giue him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer his priſoners eſtate might ſtand in need of, and that they ſhould make vſe of his patient and conſtant ſuffering for the truth of the Goſpell to themſelues, and thereby themſelues be more confirmed in the truth of the goſpell, and incouraged to beare the like troubles for it, if they ſhould bee called vnto it. <hi>(Grace be with you.)</hi> that is, the free and vndeſerued loue and fauour of God in Chriſt, with all the fruits and tokens of it, be with you. <hi>(Amen.)</hi> The word <hi>Amen</hi> being heere added to the Apoſtles peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſignifies his wiſh and deſire of that he prayed for, and it is alſo a teſtifying of his aſſurance to obtaine that which he prayed for; for that is the vſe of the word <hi>(amen)</hi> at the end and ſhutting vp of prayer, and ſo it is as much as if he had ſaid, ſo be it, I wiſh it ſo, yea I do fully beleeue it ſhall be ſo, I aſſure my ſelfe that the Lord in his good time will graunt my requeſt. Thus then are we to conceiue the apoſtles mening in the words of this verſe as if he had ſaid.</p>
                  <q>I Paul ſend ſalutations to you written with mine owne hand, and I would haue you mindfull of my impriſonment, both in praying to God for me, that he would giue me patience, ſtrength, and conſtancy in my troubles, to ſtand faſt in the defence of the Goſpell, and that he would giue me whatſoeuer my priſoners eſtate ſtandeth in neede of, and in making vſe of my ſuffering for the truth, thereby the more to confirme you in the truth of the goſpell, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to beare the like troubles, if you be called vnto them. And the free and vndeſerued loue of God in Chriſt, with all the fruits and tokens of it, be with you; ſo I wiſh and deſire, and do fully beleeue and aſſure my ſelfe it ſhall be ſo.</q>
                  <pb n="1456" facs="tcp:490:747"/>
                  <p>Come we now to ſpeake of the things heere laid before vs, in that order they are propounded by the holy ghoſt, and firſt of the Apoſtles owne ſalutation ſent to the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians: he ſent ſalutations from himſelfe to the Coloſſians, (no doubt) as a token of his true and vnfained loue to them, the point from hence offered.</p>
                  <p>That wee in like ſort may ſalute others, and thereby te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our loue vnto them.</p>
                  <p>I haue already handled, and therefore I paſſe by it, and the thing we are eſpecially to marke in theſe words is this, that the Apoſtle ſent his owne ſalutations to the Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, written not by the hand of his Secretarie, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>going ſalutations were, but with his owne hand. Now what might be the reaſon of this? (for thence we ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the doctrine,) the reaſon of it is giuen by the Apoſtle himſelfe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.17. where he thus writes, <hi>The ſalutation of me Paul, with mine owne hand, which is the token in euery Epiſtle, ſo I write:</hi> as if he had ſaid, I ſend ſalutations vnto you written with mine owne hand, and in this manner of writing, written in theſe characters, and after this forme of leters <hi>(ſo I write)</hi> as a token and certaine marke that I vſe in euery Epiſtle of mine, whereby men may know them to be (indeed) my Epiſtles, and that they come from me, and are not counterfet. Wee ſee then the reaſon why the <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Hence we may eaſily gather thus much.</p>
                  <p>That it is an ancient ſleight of Satan, and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to thruſt vpon the Church (if poſſibly hee may) forged and counterfet writings in ſtead of true, thereby to corrupt religion, and to deceiue the people of God, it is an old ſtratageme, and tricke of the Deuill (if hee can) to
<pb n="1457" facs="tcp:490:747"/> foiſt into the Church, baſtardly writings, vnder the names of Apoſtles, and other Ancient writers, thereby to ſpread many errors, and for the corrupting of ſound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was in the Apoſtles time, and therefore hee writ ſalutations with his owne hand, to preuent the danger of ſuch counterfet writings; yea this further appeares 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.2. Where hee doth beſeech them of that Church, by the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vnto him, that they ſhould not be ſuddenly moued from their mind, nor troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from him and the other Apoſtles, as if he had ſaid, there be ſome that carry about counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet letters vnder my name, but be not you ſuddenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from your minde by ſuch letters, bearing my name, or the name of ſome other Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>And this being ſo in ancient times, euen in the time of <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The reaſon and ground of this we finde, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. <hi>We are members of one bodie, and therefore ſhould haue a feeling of the hurt one of another, and be touched with it:</hi> yea ſo touched, as that we ſhould bee carefull for the good of one another.

                  <p>One thing yet remaines which is offered vnto vs from this precept (remember my bonds,) the Apoſtle would haue the Coloſſians remember his bonds by making vſe of them to themſelues for their owne confirmation in the truth of the Goſpell, the point from hence is this.</p>

                  <p>Wee haue a notable example to this purpoſe in <hi>Dauid, Pſalm.</hi> 4.6.7. there be many that ſay who will ſhew vs any good? but Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs. Thou haſt giuen me more ioy of heart, then they haue had, when their wheat and wine did abound, as if hee had ſaid, let others in the world deſire, and ſeeke after what they will, as riches, pleaſures, honours, and the like, my chiefe deſire is of the grace and fauour of the Lord, Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vppon mee, therein ſtands my chiefe ioy and comfort, yea I finde more true ioy and comfort in that, then in the increaſe of corne and wine, and in all the riches of the world.
